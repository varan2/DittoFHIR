<p>
Many of the defined elements in a resource are references to other resources. Using these
references, the resources combine to build a web of information about healthcare.
</p>
<p>
Resources contain two types of references:
</p>
<ul>
 <li><b>Internal "contained" references</b> - references to other resources packaged inside the source resource</li>
 <li><b>External references</b> - references to resources found elsewhere</li>
</ul>
<p>
References are always defined and represented in one particular direction - from one resource (source) to another (target).
References are either provided as a literal URL, which may either be absolute or relative, or as a logical identifier.
Resolving the references is discussed below.
</p>
<p>
The corresponding reverse relationship from the target to the source exists in a logical sense, but is
not represented explicitly in the target resource. For external references, navigating these reverse relationships requires some
external infrastructure to track the relationship between resources (the <a href="http.html">REST API</a> provides one such
infrastructure by providing the ability to <a href="http.html#search">search</a> the reverse relationship by naming
search parameters for the references, and by providing support for <a href="search.html#revinclude">reverse includes</a>).
</p>
<p>
Because resources are processed independently, relationships are not considered to be transitive.
For example, if a <a href="condition.html">Condition</a> resource references a particular
<a href="patient.html">Patient</a> as its subject, and references a <a href="procedure.html">Procedure</a>
resource as its cause, there is no automatic rule or implication that the procedure
has the same patient for its subject. Instead, the subject of the procedure must be established
directly in the Procedure resource itself. Another way to state this is that the context of the subject
is not "inherited", nor does it "conduct" along the relationship to procedure.
The only exception to this is the case of contained resources (see below). Note that in
practice, the relationships need to describe a logical and coherent record, and in the
case of the Condition and Procedure described here, they would usually be required to have
the same patient for their subjects, and profiles may make rules about this.
</p>

<p>
In a resource, references are represented with a <code>reference</code> (literal reference),
an <code>identifier</code> (logical reference), and a <code>display</code> (text description of target).

<h3>Literal References</h3>

<p>
The <code>reference</code> is the key element - resources are identified and addressed by their URL. It
contains a url that is either
</p>
<ul>
  <li>an absolute URL</li>
  <li>a relative URL, which is relative to the <a href="http.html#root">Service Base URL</a>, or, in a bundle, the <code>Bundle.entry.fullUrl</code> (see <a href="bundle.html#references">Resolving References in Bundles</a>)</li>
  <li>an internal fragment reference (see "Contained Resources" below)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Notes:
</p>
<ul>
 <a name="regex"> </a>
 <li>Using absolute URLs provides a stable, scalable approach suitable for a cloud/web context, while using relative/logical references provides a
   flexible approach suitable for use when trading across closed ecosystem boundaries. (see <a href="managing.html">"Managing Resource Identity"</a> for further discussion)</li>
 <li>Absolute URLs do not need to point to a <a href="http.html">FHIR RESTful server</a>, though this is the preferred approach.
   Whether or not the reference is to a FHIR RESTful server, the reference SHALL point to a Resource as defined by this specification.
   <br/>Note: This regex is true if the reference to a resource is consistent with a FHIR API:
   <pre>
   ((http|https)://([A-Za-z0-9\\\.\:\%\$]\/)*)?([%piperesources%])\/[%id_regex%](\/_history\/[%id_regex%])?
   </pre>
   <br/>
   However conformance with this regex is no guarantee that the end-point is a FHIR server
   </li>
 <li>URLs are always considered to be case-sensitive</li>
 <li>References SHALL be a reference to an actual FHIR resource, and SHALL be resolveable (allowing for access control, temporary unavailability, etc). Resolution can be either by retrieval from the URL, or, where applicable by resource type, by treating an absolute reference as a canonical URL (<a href="#canonical">see below</a>) and looking it up in a local registry/repository</li>
</ul>
<div class="example">
<p>A relative reference to the <a href="patient.html">Patient</a> "034AB16" in an element named <code>context</code> on a FHIR RESTful server:</p>
<pre class="xml" fragment="Reference">
  &lt;patient&gt;
    &lt;reference value="Patient/034AB16" /&gt;
  &lt;/patient&gt;
</pre>
<p>An absolute reference to a <a href="structuredefinition.html">Structure Definition</a> in an element named <code>profile</code>:</p>
<pre class="xml" fragment="Reference">
  &lt;profile&gt;
    &lt;reference value="http://fhir.hl7.org/svc/StructureDefinition/c8973a22-2b5b-4e76-9c66-00639c99e61b" /&gt;
  &lt;/profile&gt;
</pre>
</div>

<a name="logical"> </a>
<h3>Logical References</h3>

<p>
In many contexts where FHIR is used, applications building a resource may know an identifier for the target
of the reference, but there is no way for the application to convert this to a literal reference that
directly references an actual resource. This situation may arise for several reasons:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>There is no server exposing any such resource. This is often the case with national identifiers (e.g. US SSN or NPI), and such identifiers are widely used</li>
 <li>The server that exposes the resource is not available to the source application, so it has no way to resolve an identifier to a reference</li>
 <li>The application is not in a RESTful environment - it is creating a message or a document</li>
</ul>
<p>
In this cases, the source application may provide the identifier as a logical reference to the
entity that the target resource would describe.
</p>

<div class="example">
<p>A logical reference to the <a href="patient.html">Patient</a> with an SSN of 000111111:</p>
<pre class="xml" fragment="Reference">
  &lt;patient&gt;
    &lt;identifier&gt;
      &lt;system value=&quot;http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/us-ssn&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;value value=&quot;000111111&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/identifier&gt;
  &lt;/patient&gt;
</pre>
</div>

<p>
There is no requirement that a Reference.identifier point to something that is actually exposed as a
FHIR instance, but it SHALL point to a business concept that would be expected to be exposed as a
FHIR instance, and that instance would need to be of a FHIR resource type allowed by the reference.
</p>

<p>
When processing a resource, an application
may be able to use the identifier directly, on the grounds that all it needs is the identifier,
or it may be able to resolve the identifier directly. Alternatively, it may be able to use
a server to resolve the logical reference to a literal reference to a resource.
</p>
<p>
Irrespective of how the resolution occurs, any system processing a logical reference will only be
able to resolve the identifier to a reference if it understands the business context in which the
identifier is used. Sometimes this is global (e.g. a national identifier) but often it is not.
</p>
<p>
For this reason, none of the useful mechanisms described for working with references (e.g.
<a href="search.html#chaining">chaining</a>, <a href="search.html#include">includes</a>) are
possible, nor should servers be expected to be able to automatically resolve the reference.
Servers may accept an identifier based reference untouched, resolve it, and/or reject it - see
<a href="capabilitystatement-definitions.html#CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.referencePolicy">CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.referencePolicy</a>.
</p>
<p>
When both an identifier and a literal reference are provided, the literal reference is preferred.
Applications processing the resource are allowed - but not required - to check that the identifier
matches the literal reference, if they understand how to resolve the logical reference.
</p>
<p>
Applications converting a logical reference to a literal reference may choose to leave the
logical reference present, or remove it.
</p>

<a name="display"> </a>
<h3>Reference Description</h3>

<p>
Irrespective of whether a literal and/or logical reference is provided, or neither, the
<code>display</code> element may be used to provide a very short description of the
target resource.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="xml" fragment="Reference">
  &lt;custodian&gt;
    &lt;reference value="Organization/123" /&gt;
    &lt;display value="HL7, Inc" /&gt;
  &lt;/custodian&gt;
</pre>
<p>
This text can be used by any application that cannot resolve the reference
to fill out the text portion of a hyperlink referring to the target resource, for instance.
It can also save time fetching a target resource, and determining how to convert it to
a very short textual description.
</p>
</div>
<p>
In general, the <code>display</code>, if populated, does not have identical content
to the Resource.text of the referenced resource.  The purpose is to identify what's
being referenced, not to more fully describe it.
</p>

<a name="canonical"> </a>
<h3>Canonical URLs</h3>
<p>
Many resource types have a defined element "url" which is the canonical URL that always identifies the
resource. These include all the conformance and knowledge resources (most of the resources
not found in the <a href="compartmentdefinition-patient.html">Patient Compartment</a>).
</p>
<p>
The canonical URL remains the same when the resource is copied from server to server, while the logical
id of the resource - its local identifier - usually changes as the resource is copied. The canonical
URL serves as a stable logical identifier for the conformance artifact, and <b>is the preferred
way to reference a conformance or knowledge resource</b>. The canonical URL is also the location where the master copy of
the artifact is found.
</p>
<p>
References to these resources may use the <code>Reference</code> type described above,
but they can also be referenced using a <a href="datatypes.html#uri"><code>uri</code></a>.
</p>
<p>
When the type of the canonical reference is a <code>uri</code>, the URL may include a
version, in order be precise about which version of the resource is being referred to.
To do this, append the version to the canonical url with a '|' like this:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;valueSetUri value=&quot;http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/my-profile|0.8&quot;/&gt;
</pre>
<p>
This is a version specific reference to a profile. Note that this is the <code>StructureDefinition.version</code>
not the <code>StructureDefinition.meta.versionId</code>. Searching for this on a FHIR server would look like this:
</p>
<pre>
GET fhir/ValueSet?url=http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/clinical-findings&amp;version=0.8
</pre>
<p>
Note that if a canonical reference does not have a version, and the server finds multiple
versions for the value set, the system using the reference should pick the latest version
of the target resource and use that. Servers SHOULD support version specific searching for canonical
URLs but automatically detecting the presence of a |[version] and performing the appropriate
search.
</p>
<p>
Systems resolving references to resources that might have canonical URLs SHOULD first
try to resolve the reference using the canonical URL, and then fall back to direct
resolution using the URL as a literal reference if a local version of the canonical
resource cannot be found. This approach is safe because the local version cannot be
a different artifact than the master copy, though implementations will need to make
appropriate arrangements regarding the currency of their local copy of the artifact.
</p>


<a name="contained"> </a>
<h3>Contained Resources</h3>
<p>
In some circumstances, the content referred to in the resource reference does not have an independent
existence apart from the resource that contains it - it cannot be identified independently, and nor
can it have its own independent transaction scope. Typically, such circumstances arise where resources
are being assembled by a secondary user of the source data, such as a middleware engine. If the data available
when the resource is constructed does not include record keys or absolute identification information, then
a properly identified resource cannot be assembled, and even if an arbitrary identification was associated
with it, the resource could never be the subject of a transaction outside the context of the resource that
refers to it.
</p>
<p>
For example, consider a situation where an interface engine is creating a <a href="condition.html">Condition</a>
record on a patient from an <a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=185">HL7 v2</a> message, and the only information about the primary surgeon is her
first name and last name (REL-7.2 &amp; REL-7.3). In the absence of a controlled practitioner directory,
this is not enough information to create an identified <a href="practitioner.html">Practitioner</a>
resource since more than one practitioner might have the same name.
</p>
<p>
In these circumstances, the resource is placed directly in-line in the resource. <b>This SHOULD NOT be
done when the content can be identified properly, as once the identification is lost, it is extremely difficult
(and context dependent) to restore it again.</b>
</p>
<div class="example">
<p>
An example of a contained resource:
</p>
<pre class="xml" fragment="Condition">
 &lt;Condition xmlns="http://hl7.org/fhir"&gt;
  &lt;contained&gt;
    &lt;Practitioner&gt;
      &lt;id value=&quot;p1&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;name&gt;
        &lt;family value=&quot;Person&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;given value=&quot;Patricia&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;/Practitioner&gt;
  &lt;/contained&gt;
  &lt;!-- other attributes --&gt;
  &lt;asserter&gt;
    &lt;reference value="#p1" /&gt;
  &lt;/asserter&gt;
  &lt;!-- other attributes --&gt;
 &lt;/Condition&gt;
</pre>
<p>
The same example in JSON:
</p>
<pre class="json" fragment="Condition">
{
  "resourceType" : "Condition",
  "contained": [
    {
      "resourceType" : "Practitioner",
      "id" : "p1",
      "name" : [{
        "family" : "Person",
        "given" : ["Patricia"]
      }]
	  }],
   "asserter" : {
     "reference" : "#p1"
  }
}
</pre>
</div>

<div class="design-note">
<p>
Design Note: Contained resources are still a reference rather than being inlined directly
into the element that is the reference (e.g. "custodian" above) to ensure that a
single approach to resolving resource references can be used. Though direct containment
would seem simpler, it would still be necessary to support internal references where the
same contained resource is referenced more than once. In the end, all that it would achieve
is creating additional options in the syntax. For users using XPath to process the resource,
the following XPath fragment resolves the internal reference:
</p>
<pre>
ancestor::f:*[not(parent::f:*)]/f:contained/*[@id=substring-after(<b>current()</b>/f:reference/@value, '#')]
</pre>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>
Some notes about use and interpretation of contained resources:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <code>contained</code> element SHALL NOT have extensions on it (though contained resources can still contain extensions).</li>
  <li>The contained resource can be put in any resource that inherits from DomainResource. The contained element is then located at the
  beginning of the resource after any text narrative and before any extension.</li>
  <li>Contained resources share the same internal id resolution space as the parent resource (for id attributes, see below).</li>
  <li>When resolving references, references are resolved by looking through the 'container' resource - the one that contains the other
  resources. Since there are no nested contained resources, there is only one container resource.</li>
  <li>References to contained resources are never resolved outside the container resource. Specifically, resolution stops at the elements
  Bundle.entry.resource and Parameters.parameter.resource, but not at DomainResource.contained.</li>
  <li>Contained resources SHALL NOT contain additional contained resources.</li>
  <li>Contained resources SHALL NOT contain any narrative.</li>
  <li>A contained resource SHALL only be included in a resource if something in that resource (potentially another contained resource) has a reference to it.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Resources that are contained inline do not "inherit" context from their parent resource. For instance, if
the parent resource contains a "subject", and the contained resource also has a "subject" element defined,
there is no implication that the contained resource has the same subject as the parent resource.
</p>

<p>
Resources can only be contained in other resources if there is a reference from the resource to
the contained resource. This is intended to ensure that the meaning of the contained resource
is clear, and that there is no confusion as to its significance.
</p>

<blockquote class="stu-note">
<a name="dstu2"> </a>
<p>
<b>STU Note:</b> There are some identified use cases where it would be useful to include resources that refer
to the contained resource rather than the container referring to the contained resource, but this
has a series of structural ramifications for the API. Whether these can be resolved is an open
issue for investigation during the period of trial use.
