  Requirements = Some business processes need to know if multiple items were ordered as part of the same \"prescription\" or \"requisition\" for billing or other purposes.
  Comments = Requests are linked either by a \"basedOn\" relationship (i.e. one request is fulfilling another) or by having a common requisition.  Requests that are part of the same requisition are generally treated independently from the perspective of changing their state or maintaining them after initial creation.

States relating to the activities of the performer are reflected on either the corresponding [[[Event]]](s) or using the [[[Task]]] resource.\n\nA nominal state-transition diagram can be found in the [[request.html#statemachine | Request pattern]] documentation\n\nUnknown does not represent \"other\" - one of the defined statuses must apply.

Can have multiple codes that map to one of these.  E.g. \"original order\", \"encoded order\", \"reflex order\" would all map to \"order\".  Expectation is that the set of codes is mutually exclusive or a strict all-encompassing hierarchy.
