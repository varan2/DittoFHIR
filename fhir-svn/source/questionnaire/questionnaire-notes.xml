Notes:
</h2>
<ul>
<li>Questionnaires may be used to represent predefined forms or panels, referenced using items of type "group"</li>
<li>Questions may be nested.  The Questionnaire resource supports nested items beneath both items of type "group" (which doesn't capture an answer of its own) as well as beneath questions</li>
<li>Groups and Questions may have linkIds allowing groups and question answers captured in a <a href="questionnaireresponse.html">QuestionnaireResponse</a>
to be associated with their corresponding group or question.</li>
<li>Questionnaire allows for flexible naming and structuring of its contents to reflect the flexible and varying nature of forms and questionnaires.
It explicitly does not try to standardize or streamline exchange of its contents outside its context of use, although exchanging partners may further
constrain its structure and flexibility using profiles to define standardized, reusable forms.</li>
<li>Because of the lack of explicit support for Questionnaires in <a href="https://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=186">HL7 v3</a>, <a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=7">CDA</a> Documents frequently used named sections with
Observations to model Questionnaires. Such use cases should now use the Questionnaire Resource instead.</li>
<li>The order of questions within groups, groups within groups and groups within questions is relevant and must be retained for display and capture.</li>
<li>Display items allow the inclusion of instructions, background information and similar content within a questionnaire.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Using Questionnaires versus using Resources</h3>
<p>
There is considerable overlap between the information covered by <b>Questionnaires</b> and other Resources (especially <a href="familymemberhistory.html">FamilyMemberHistory</a>,
<a href="medicationstatement.html">MedicationStatement</a>, <a href="observation.html">Observation</a>, <a href="procedure.html">Procedure</a>, etc.).
<b>Questionnaire's</b> flexible structure can easily be misused to capture any data, even data that should be captured as separate Resources. The choice between using <b>Questionnaires</b> or separate
Resources may be dictated by the procedure of collection and recording; e.g. if the data is captured as a physician-agreed (electronic) form, it might be impossible or undesirable to
distill separate resources from it and capturing the data in a <b>Questionnaire</b> would be most appropriate.
</p>

<p>
However, data captured only in <b>Questionnaires</b> can be difficult to query after-the-fact. Queries against other Resources will not return data captured only in <b>Questionnaires</b>,
and querying against <b>Questionnaires</b> directly may not find all desired data, depending on how the questions may have been phrased or encoded over time or by different clinicians.
Moreover, interoperability of such <b>Questionnaires</b> is limited, as interpretation of its contents is only known to the circle of parties that were involved in its definition: encoding data from
such <b>Questionnaires</b> using more specific resources increases the availability of the information they contain.
</p>

<p>
It is entirely possible for data to exist in both QuestionnaireResponse and in other resources.  For example, data may be captured in
<a href="questionnaireresponse.html">QuestionnaireResponse</a> as part of an intake questionnaire.  That data may then be propagated into the
<a href="patient.html">Patient</a> resource (demographics), <a href="familymemberhistory.html">FamilyMemberHistory</a>, <a href="allergyintolerance.html">AllergyIntolerance</a>,
<a href="medicationstatement.html">MedicationStatement</a> and <a href="observation.html">Observation</a> resources to allow the data to be queried and analyzed.  The original
<a href="questionnaireresponse.html">QuestionnaireResponse</a> instance can be retained for traceability purposes.  If desired, a <a href="provenance.html">Provenance</a> resource
can be used to identify the Questionnaire as the data source for the other resources.  For example, if a questionnaire question asks "what is your weight", an <a href="observation.html">Observation</a> with the appropriate <code>Observation.code</code> and the specified answer as the
<code>Observation.valueQuantity</code> can be created.
</p>

<h3>Structure of the Questionnaire</h3>
<p>
A Questionnaire is built out of two components, Questionnaire and item:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The main component is Questionnaire, which holds information <em>about</em> the Questionnaire,
  like the identifier, publisher, date authored, title, etc. The Questionnaire contains zero or more items which define the content of the questionnaire  (zero items allows for the possibility of narrative-only questionnaires, though these provide little computable information).</li>
  <li>Items have one of three sub-types, distinguished by the <code>type</code> element:
    <ul>
      <li><b>display</b> items convey text to be rendered on the form that won't capture data and which won't contain nested items.  This might include copyright or authorship information,
        instructions or other background information.</li>
      <li><b>group</b> items organize content of the questionnaire into sections, sub-sections, etc.  Groups don't have answers associated with them directly, but generally contain child
        'question' items which do.  </li>
      <li><b>question</b> items ask a specific question to which an answer may be given.  There isn't a single
        <code>type</code> for question items. Instead, the type conveys the data type of the answer for the question.  If an item isn't a 'display' or a 'group', then it's a question which allows a particular type of answer to be gathered. Questions may also have nested content - groups and/or
        other questions. This way, one can model "panels" of questions which would only be relevant (and thus would only be displayed)
        depending on the answers of a parent question; e.g. a question "Did the patient receive treatment in the past six months?" would contain a nested
        group of questions asking for further details about the treatment. See an <a href="questionnaire-example-bluebook.xml.html">example</a> from
        the <a href="http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Kids/Publications/my-personal-health-record.pdf">Australian New South Wales blue book</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
Specific controls on dynamic display of groups, questions, etc. based on the answers to other questions is outside the scope of the base resource and
are handled using extensions.</p>

<h3>Identifiers within Questionnaire</h3>
<p>There are three different "identifying" elements within Questionnaire: <code>identifier</code>, <code>id</code> and <code>linkId</code>.  Each serves very distinct
purposes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <b>identifier</b> element is used to reference the overall questionnaire in business terms.  It is the number printed across the top of the form or listed beside the form
  when making a choice between alternate forms.</li>
  <li>The <b>id</b> attribute supported on each element is used for references within a resource, for example linking narrative to discrete elements.  Ids are not generally displayed to end users</li>
  <li>The <b>linkId</b> element on questions and groups establishes a link between elements in a <a href="questionnaireresponse.html">QuestionnaireResponse</a> and their
  definition inside a Questionnaire.  This is the <i>only</i> way to link between the groups and questions in a Questionnaire and QuestionnaireResponse.  These are also not displayed to end users</li>
</ul>

<h3>Question Definitions</h3>
<p>
Questionnaires can be crafted using any questions the author can conceive and can be phrased in whatever manner is appropriate or convenient.  However, standardization of
questions and the constraints enforced on the accompanying answers increases the ability to compare data gathered across questionnaires.  <!--There are two
mechanisms defined in the specification for linking a Question (or Group) to a standardized definition:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <code>concept</code> element on both Group and Question allows an individual question, a group of questions or even the questionnaire as a whole to be associated
  with a pre-defined terminology of questions and question groups such as LOINC</li>
  <li>The <a href="questionnaire-extensions.html#deReference">deReference</a> extension allows a question or group to be associated with the
  <a href="dataelement.html">DataElement</a> (DE) resource that formally defines the data element.</li>
</ul>
-->
Items can be directly linked to an <a href="elementdefinition.html">ElementDefinition</a> using <code>Questionnaire.item.definition</code>
which provides details for the item. If a definition is provided, then the following element values can be derived from the definition:
</p>
<ul>
<li>concept (from ElementDefinition.code)</li>
<li>type (from ElementDefinition.type)</li>
<li>required (from ElementDefinition.min)</li>
<li>repeats (from ElementDefinition.max)</li>
<li>maxLength (from ElementDefinition.maxLength)</li>
<li>options (from ElementDefinition.binding)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Any information provided in these elements overrides the information from the definition.
The url refers to a an ElementDefinition in  <a href="structuredefinition.html">StructureDefinition</a>, and always starts with the canonical URL for the target resource.
When referring to a StructureDefinition, a fragment identifier is used to specify the element definition by its
id (Element.id). E.g. http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Observation#Observation.value[x]. In the absence
of a fragment identifier, the first/root element definition in the target is the matching element definition.
</p>
<p>
The definitions may also be used to automatically pre-populate answers, or extract data from a corresponding <a href="questionnaireresponse.html">QuestionnaireResponse</a> resource.
</p>
<p>
NOTE: Even if a standard question definition is provided<!--s are referenced using <code>concept</code> or the <code>deReference</code> extension-->, information such as the question text,
data type and value set SHOULD still be declared for the question.  Systems processing the questionnaire may not have access to or support the ability to look
up the question definitions from external sources.  If the information is not included in-line within the questionnaire, other systems may not be able to render
or use the Questionnaire.
</p>
<p>
If an external definition <!--reference (<code>concept</code> or <code>deReference</code> extension)--> is included along with question information such as question text, data type or
value set, it is expected that the content for the question and the referenced definition would be in alignment.  However, FHIR does not dictate what degree of
alignment is required; e.g. Does the question text need to match exactly?  Is it legitimate for a question to constrain the allowed value set of possible answers?
These rules will need to be established within implementation environments.
</p>

<h3>Question types</h3>
<p>
The codes for the data type for each question are slightly different than the data types allowed in the <a href="questionnaireresponse.html">QuestionnaireResponse</a> resource.
Where the names are the same (ignoring case), the "answer" must use the specified type.  Where the names are different, the mappings are as follows:
</p>
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Questionnaire AnswerFormat code</th>
      <th>QuestionnaireResponse data type</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>text</td>
      <td><a href="datatypes.html#string">string</a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>url</td>
      <td><a href="datatypes.html#uri">uri</a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>choice</td>
      <td><a href="datatypes.html#Coding">Coding</a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>open-choice</td>
      <td><a href="datatypes.html#Coding">Coding</a> (if choosing from one of the listed choices) or <a href="datatypes.html#string">string</a> (if a different value is provided)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<a name="choices"> </a>
<h3>Permitted values for questions</h3>
<p>
Many questionnaires place constraints on the allowed list of values for a given question.  FHIR supports this notion through the <code>item.options</code> or the
<code>item.option</code> element.
</p>
<p>
The "option" mechanism is simplest - all options are listed in-line with the question using the <code>item.option</code> element.  Maintenance of the set of permitted question answers involves maintenance of
the questionnaire itself.
</p>
<p>
The "options" mechanism is more sophisticated.  Rather than listing the options directly, the <code>item.options</code> element points to a <a href="valueset.html">ValueSet</a> resource.  This approach adds complexity for
questionnaires having a simple list of strings as choices for a question, but provides several benefits, including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Questionnaires that reference codes from externally defined code systems have a means of doing so</li>
  <li>Answer sets can be shared across questions (and there are many questionnaires where this capability is useful)</li>
  <li>The full capability of value sets can be brought into play, including the ability to use ConceptMap to link and translate from questionnaire-specific codes to
  other codes, the use of multiple display names (e.g. different languages), the ability to use coded ordinals, and the ability to allow choices from larger value sets
  (e.g. "all SNOMED CT procedure codes")</li>
</ul>
<p>
In many cases, the set of code choices will be specific to a given questionnaire and should be maintained as part of the questionnaire.  In this case, the referenced
ValueSet can be included as a <a href="references.html#contained">contained</a> resource.  All contained ValueSets are listed together and then are referenced by the
individual questions as necessary.  Alternatively, the <code>item.options</code> element can reference the value set in a version-specific manner.  This ensures that the Questionnaire
will not adopt a new version of the referenced value set without revising the Questionnaire to point to that new version - putting the author of the Questionnaire
in control of any changes.
</p>

<h3>Useful Value Sets</h3>
<p>
Many questions have a common set of possible codes for their answer. These value sets may be useful to help,
and when referenced by full URL, do not need to be provided as part of the questionnaire:
</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="valueset-example-yesnodontknow.html">Yes | No | Don't Know</a>: http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/yesnodontknow</li>
</ul>

<h3>Questions with multiple answer types</h3>
<p>
In some questionnaires, it may be possible to respond to a question with multiple types of answers.  For example, capturing a coded answer plus free text,
capturing a coded value plus a numeric priority, etc.  In FHIR, this is handled through nested questions.  Each question has a single data type.  However,
each question can have nested child questions.  These nested child questions can have text (e.g. "Please specify") or can have no text at all if the appropriate
guidance is provided by the parent question or group.
</p>

<h3>Questionnaires with Math</h3>
<p>
Many questionnaires involve computations on questionnaire answers, e.g. tabulating scores.

To help with associating numeric values to coded answers, there are two extensions defined - one for defining the numeric weighting of a code defined in a value set -
<a href="extension-valueset-ordinalvalue.html">valueset-ordinalValue</a> and the other for defining a code that can appear within a Coding itself -
<a href="extension-iso21090-co-value.html">iso21090-CO-value</a>.
</p>

<p>In addition, there are extensions for defining the dynamic value of an element usings expressions. For more information, see the <a href="cqif/cqif-topics-using-expressions.html">Using Expressions</a> and <a href="cqif/cqif-knowledge-artifact-representation.html#documentation-template">Documentation Template</a> topics in the Clinical Reasoning module.</p>
