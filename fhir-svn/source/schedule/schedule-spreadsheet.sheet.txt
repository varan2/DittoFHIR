  RIM Mapping = n/a
  iCal Mapping = BEGIN:VFREEBUSY  ???  END:VFREEBUSY (If your fhir server provides this information via calDAV, then you may want to include addressing information in a URL section, and with the search, a DTSTART and DTEND component can be included to indicate the range of time that has been covered in the collection of slots, where these overlap the resources period values. For all slots that reference this resource, include a FREEBUSY row for each slot)
  w5 = workflow.scheduling

  Short Name = The resource this Schedule resource is providing availability information for. These are expected to usually be one of HealthcareService, Location, Practitioner, PractitionerRole, Device, Patient or RelatedPerson
  Comments = The capacity to support multiple referenced resource types should be used in cases where the specific resources themselves cannot be scheduled without the other, and thus only make sense to the system exposing them as a group. Common examples of this are where the combination of a pracitioner and a room(location) are always required by a system.
  iCal Mapping = ATTENDEE:MAILTO:john_public@host2.com This can be populated with a value from the referenced resource
  Committee Notes = Many discussions were had at 2 WGMs over the name of this field, and considered individual, subject and several others, but landed on this property name as it doesn\'t have other meanings and is applicable for people, services, locations and devices, also this has been updated to support multiple actors for a single schedule where they are not managed seperately (e.g. context where a practitioner and location are not available alone)
