   <h2>Notes:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Time zones and recurring appointments</li>
        <p>Recurring appointments need to have the time zone defined in which the values were entered.
				Knowing that the start time was at 9:00:00Z+10 does not mean that the same time in 2 weeks is actually the same. 
        </p>
			<p>
				As if this was a time in Brisbane Australia, this time will be the same (in respect to its offset from UTC),
				however if this was for Melbourne Australia, during the daylight savings period of time Melbourne becomes +11.
				So without the additional information as to which time zone it was created in, scheduling a 9am appointment every
				Wednesday would not be possible.
