  Requirements = Creating a FamilyMemberHistory where notDone is true is intended for situations where there\'s a need for a specific statement in the record about something not being done.  If the need is merely to indicate that a request wasn\'t fulfilled, that should be handled using Task.
  Comments = This element is labeled as a modifier because it marks the family member history as a family member history that did not occur.  The more attributes are populated, the more constrained the negated statement is.  This notDone element is being evaluated and will likely be removed in a subsequent release.
