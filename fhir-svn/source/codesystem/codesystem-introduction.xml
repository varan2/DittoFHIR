<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
The FHIR terminology specification is based on two key concepts, originally defined in <a href="http://www.hl7.org/documentcenter/public/standards/V3/core_principles/infrastructure/coreprinciples/v3modelcoreprinciples.html">HL7 v3 Core Principles</a>:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <b>code system</b> - defines a set of codes with meanings (also known as enumeration, terminology, classification, and/or ontology)</li>
<li> <b>value set</b> - selects a set of codes from those defined by one or more code systems</li>
</ul>
<p>
Code systems define which codes (symbols and/or expressions) exist, and how they are understood. Value Sets 
select a set of codes from one or more code systems to specify which codes can be used in a particular context.
</p>
<p>
The CodeSystem resource is used to declare the existence of a code system, and its key properties:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Identifying URL and version</li>
 <li>Description, Copyright, publication date, and other metadata</li>
 <li>Some key properties of the code system itself - whether it's case sensitive, version safe, and whether it defines a compositional grammar</li>
 <li>What filters can be used in value sets that use the code system in a ValueSet.compose element</li> 
 <li>What properties the concepts defined by the code system</li>
</ul>
<p>
In addition, the CodeSystem resource may list some or all of the concepts in the code system, along with
their basic properties (code, display, definition), designations, and additional properties.
</p>
<p>
The CodeSystem resource is not intended to support the process of maintaining a 
code system. Instead, the focus is on publishing the properties and optionally 
the content of a code system for use throughout the FHIR eco-system, such as to support value set expansion and validation. Note that 
the important existing (large) code systems (SNOMED CT, LOINC, RxNorm, ICD family, etc) 
all have their own distribution formats, and there is no intent that the CodeSystem
resource be used for distributing these kind of terminologies. Instead, it is 
intended to be used for distributing the smaller ad-hoc code systems that are 
ubiqutiously encountered through out the healthcare process.

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Code systems are used in <a href="valueset.html">ValueSet</a> resources</li>
 <li>The <a href="datatypes.html#Coding">Coding</a> data type refers to CodeSystem resources by their canonical URL</li>
 <li>The CodeSystem resource design is based on the functionality described in the <a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/CTS2/1.0/">OMG CTS 2</a> specification. CodeSystem resources can be converted to CTS2 
 code system resources.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The <code>CodeSystem</code> resource defines the content of a code system, and also its preferred identifier.
The <code>NamingSystem</code> resource identifies the existence of a code or identifier system, and its possible and preferred identifiers. 
The key difference between the resources is who creates and manages them - <code>CodeSystem</code> resources are managed
by the owner of the code system resource, who can properly define the features and content of the code system.
<code>NamingSystem</code> resources, on the other hand, are frequently defined by 3rd parties that encounter the
code system in use, and need to describe the use, but do not have the authority to define the features and content. 
Additionally, there may be multiple authoritative <code>NamingSystem</code> resources for a code systemn, but there
should only be one <code>CodeSystem</code> resource.

<h2>Background and Context</h2>

<p>
When using code systems and value sets, proper differentiation between a code system and a value set is important. 
This is one very common area where significant clinical safety risks occur in practice. Implementers
should be familiar with the content in <a href="terminologies.html">Using Codes in resources</a>.
</p>
<p>
Each code system has 2 different URLs that can be used to reference it - its logical identifier, and 
its location.
</p>
<p>
The location of the code system is a URL by which it may be retrieved, usually from a FHIR 
server, and may be a relative reference to a code system on the same server. 
The logical identifier is in the code system itself, in 
<a href="codesystem-definitions.html#CodeSystem.url">CodeSystem.url</a>. This 
is the logical identity (sometimes called the canonical URL) that refers to this 
code system across all systems. Ideally, the URL should also be the location of the 
master version of the code system, though this is not always possible. 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
For example, the code systems published as part of FHIR all have a logical URL
which is also a location by which they may be accessed in the FHIR specification
itself. However, while a new version of the FHIR Specification is being prepared,
code systems that are published in the drafts will not be found in the current FHIR
specification. 
</p>
<p>
Because it is common practice to copy (cache) code systems locally, most 
references to code systems can be either a logical or a literal URL. 
</p>

</blockquote>


<h3>CodeSystem Identification</h3>
<p>
A code system has 3 identifiers:
</p>
<ul>
 <li><code>CodeSystem.id</code>: the <a href="resource.html#id">logical id</a> on the system that holds the code system - this changes as it moves from server to server (this id, with the server address prepended, is called the 'literal identity' of the resource)</li>
 <li><code>CodeSystem.url</code>: the canonical URL that never changes for this code system - it is the same in every copy. Ideally, the URL should also be the location of the master version of the code system, though this is not always possible</li>
 <li><code>CodeSystem.identifier</code>: A system/value pair that is used to identify the code system in other contexts (such as an OID in an <a href="https://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=186">HL7 v3</a> specification)</li>
</ul>
<p>
For further information regarding resource identification, see <a href="resource.html#id">Resource Identity</a>.
</p>

<p>
This means that each code system has 2 different URLs that can be used to reference it - 
its canonical <code>url</code>, and its local location from which it may be retrieved. 
Because it is common practice to copy (cache) code systems locally, most references to 
code systems use the canonical URL. 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
For example, the code systems published as part of FHIR all have a canonical URL
which is also a location by which they may be accessed in the FHIR specification
itself. Note, though, that while a new version of the FHIR Specification is being prepared,
code systems that are published in the drafts will not be found in the published FHIR
specification at their canonical URL. 
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Alternatively, the <code>identifier</code> and <code>version</code> elements may be used to reference this code system in a 
design, a profile, a <a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=7">CDA</a> template 
or <a href="https://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=186">HL7 v3</a> message (in the CD data 
type codeSystem and codeSystemVersion properties). These different contexts may make additional restrictions on the 
possible values of these elements.  The <code>identifier</code> is generally not needed when using code systems in
a FHIR context, where the canonical URL is always the focus.
