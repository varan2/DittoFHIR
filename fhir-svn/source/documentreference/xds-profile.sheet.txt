  Short Name = XDSDocumentEntry.eventCodeList
  Definition = This list of codes represents the main clinical acts, such as a colonoscopy or an appendectomy, being documented. In some cases, the event is inherent in the typeCode, such as a \"History and Physical Report\" in which the procedure being documented is necessarily a \"History and Physical\" act
  Comments = An event can further specialize the act inherent in the typeCode, such as where it is simply \"Procedure Report\" and the procedure was a \"colonoscopy\". If one or more eventCodes are included, they shall not conflict with the values inherent in the classCode, practiceSettingCode or typeCode, as such a conflict would create an ambiguous situation.
