  Conformance = extensible

=== Sheet Invariants =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Id = 1
  Context = Organization
  English = The organization SHALL at least have a name or an id, and possibly more than one
  XPath = count(f:identifier | f:name) > 0
  Expression = (identifier.count() + name.count()) > 0

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Id = 2
  Context = Organization.address
  English = An address of an organization can never be of use \'home\'
  XPath = count(f:use[@value=\'home\']) = 0
  Expression = where(use = \'home\').empty()

 -- Row 3 -----------------------------------
  Id = 3
  Context = Organization.telecom
  English = The telecom of an organization can never be of use \'home\'
  XPath = count(f:use[@value=\'home\']) = 0

=== Sheet Data Elements =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Element = Organization
  Type = DomainResource
  Short Name = A grouping of people or organizations with a common purpose
  Definition = A formally or informally recognized grouping of people or organizations formed for the purpose of achieving some form of collective action.  Includes companies, institutions, corporations, departments, community groups, healthcare practice groups, etc.
  v2 Mapping = (also see master files messages)
  RIM Mapping = Organization(classCode=ORG, determinerCode=INST)
  ServD Mapping = Organization
  w5 = administrative.group

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Element = Organization.identifier
  Card. = 0..*
  Summary = Y
  Inv. = 1
  Type = Identifier
  Short Name = Identifies this organization  across multiple systems
  Definition = Identifier for the organization that is used to identify the organization across multiple disparate systems
  Requirements = Organizations are known by a variety of ids. Some institutions maintain several, and most collect identifiers for exchange with other organizations concerning the organization.
  v2 Mapping = XON.10 / XON.3
  RIM Mapping = .scopes[Role](classCode=IDENT)
  ServD Mapping = ./Identifiers
  w5 = id

 -- Row 3 -----------------------------------
  Element = Organization.active
  Card. = 0..1
  Is Modifier = y
  Summary = Y
  Type = boolean
  Short Name = Whether the organization\'s record is still in active use
  Definition = Whether the organization\'s record is still in active use
  Requirements = Need a flag to indicate a record is no longer to be used and should generally be hidden for the user in the UI.
  Comments = Default is true.\n\nThis active flag is not intended to be used to mark an organizations as temporarily closed or under construction. Instead the Location(s) within the Organization should have the suspended status. If further details of the reason for the suspension are required, then an extension on this element should be used.\n\nThis element is labeled as a modifier because it may be used to mark that the resource was created in error
  v2 Mapping = No equivalent in HL7 v2
  RIM Mapping = .status
  ServD Mapping = ./Status (however this concept in ServD more covers why the organization is active or not, could be delisted, deregistered, not operational yet) this could alternatively be derived from ./StartDate and ./EndDate and given a context date.
  Committee Notes = Lloyd(?): This isn\'t data we record about an organization but is data about this organization\'s record. I would argue about including this metadata here. It also implies effects on functionality, like not showing up in queries anymore, which cannot be guaranteed. All in all, this belongs to record infrastructure, not data. Status of Organization is different type to Location as the status of a Location is not always binary, as it can be on hold, whereas for the Organizations either they are active or not.
  Default Value = True
  w5 = status

 -- Row 4 -----------------------------------
  Element = Organization.type
  Card. = 0..*
  Summary = Y
  Type = CodeableConcept
  Binding = OrganizationType
  Short Name = Kind of organization
  Definition = The kind(s) of organization that this is
  Requirements = Need to be able to track the kind of organization that this is - different organization types have different uses
  Comments = Organizations can be corporations, wards, sections, clinical teams, government departments, etc. Note that code is generally a classifier of the type of organization; in many applications, codes are used to identity a particular organization (say, ward) as opposed to another of the same type - these are identifiers, not codes\n\nWhen considering if multiple types are appropriate, you should evaluate if child organizations would be a more appropriate use of the concept, as different types likely are in different sub-areas of the organization. This is most likely to be used where type values have orthogonal values, such as a religious, academic and medical center.\n\nWe expect that some jurisdictions will profile this optionality to be a single cardinality.
  v2 Mapping = No equivalent in v2
  RIM Mapping = .code

  v2 Mapping = XON.1
  RIM Mapping = .name
  ServD Mapping = .PreferredName/Name
  Committee Notes = If you need multiple names to cater for acronyms and \"trading under\" names, use an extension \"alias\" instead

 -- Row 6 -----------------------------------
  Element = Organization.alias
  Card. = 0..*
  Type = string
  Short Name = A list of alternate names that the organization is known as, or was known as in the past
  Requirements = Over time locations and organizations go through many changes and can be known by different names.\n\nFor searching knowing previous names that the organization was known by can be very useful.
  Comments = There are no dates associated with the alias/historic names, as this is not intended to track when names were used, but to assist in searching so that older names can still result in identifying the organization
  RIM Mapping = .name
  Committee Notes = This is used in many registries, and is often very important in searching

  Inv. = 3
  Type = ContactPoint
  Short Name = A contact detail for the organization

  v2 Mapping = Roughly analogous to person-specific CER segment in HL7 v2
  RIM Mapping = .plays[Role](classCode=\'QUAL\')
  ServD Mapping = Could be mapped via ./Attrbutes or ./Affiliations
  To Do = 1) Not sure if qualified & accredited are the same.  2) Could potentially propose a new classCode. We wonder if Accreditation is in the 80%. Accreditation is not part of the current PA domain, it was in Personnel Management but this has been retracted. The PM version also had many more attributes, so is this Accreditation good enough? We (current participants) do not use it. We decide to keep it, to see what happens in ballot

  Definition = The organization that conferred/confers the accreditation
  Requirements = May determine the significance of the qualification, and allows a link back to a qualification registry, if one exists
  RIM Mapping = .scopedBy[Organization]
  To Do = Lloyd(?): Do we need jurisdiction as well?  (The jurisdiction is often more relevant than the accrediting org.)  EK: Isn\'t a jurisdiction an organization?

 -- Row 13 -----------------------------------
  Element = !Organization.accreditation.period
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = Period
  Short Name = When the accreditation is valid (date only)
