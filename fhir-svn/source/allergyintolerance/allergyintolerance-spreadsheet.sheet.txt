  Definition = Identification of the underlying physiological mechanism for the reaction risk.
  Comments = Allergic (typically immune-mediated) reactions have been traditionally regarded as an indicator for potential escalation to significant future risk. Contemporary knowledge suggests that some reactions previously thought to be immune-mediated are, in fact, non-immune, but in some cases can still pose a life threatening risk. It is acknowledged that many clinicians may not be in a position to distinguish the mechanism of a particular reaction. Often the term \"allergy\" is used rather generically and may overlap with the use of \"intolerance\" - in practice the boundaries between these two concepts may not be well-defined or understood. This data element is included nevertheless, because many legacy systems have captured this attribute. Immunologic testing may provide supporting evidence for the basis of the reaction and the causative substance, but no tests are 100% sensitive or specific for sensitivity to a particular substance. If, as is commonly the case, it is unclear whether the reaction is due to an allergy or an intolerance, then the type element should be omitted from the resource.

  Comments = This data element has been included because it is currently being captured in some clinical systems. This data can be derived from the substance where coding systems are used, and is effectively redundant in that situation.  When searching on category, consider the implications of AllergyIntolerance resources without a category.  For example, when searching on category = medication, medication allergies that don\'t have a category valued will not be returned.  Refer to [search](search.html) for more information on how to search category with a :missing modifier to get allergies that don\'t have a category.  Additionally, category should be used with caution because category can be subjective based on the sender.

  Short Name = low | high | unable-to-assess
  Definition = Estimate of the potential clinical harm, or seriousness, of the reaction to the identified substance
  Comments = The default criticality value for any propensity to an adverse reaction should be \'Low Risk\', indicating at the very least a relative contraindication to deliberate or voluntary exposure to the substance. \'High Risk\' is flagged if the clinician has identified a propensity for a more serious or potentially life-threatening reaction, such as anaphylaxis, and implies an absolute contraindication to deliberate or voluntary exposure to the substance. If this element is missing, the criticality is unknown (though it may be known elsewhere).\n\nSystems that capture a severity at the condition level are actually representing the concept of criticality whereas the severity documented at the reaction level is representing the true reaction severity.  Existing systems that are capturing both condition criticality and reaction severity may use the term \"severity\" to represent both.  Criticality is the worst it could be in the future (i.e. situation-agnostic) whereas severity is situation-dependent.

  Type = CodeableConcept

  Short Name = Code that identifies the allergy or intolerance
  Definition = Code for an allergy or intolerance statement (either a positive or a negated/excluded statement).  This may be a code for a substance or pharmaceutical product that is considered to be responsible for the adverse reaction risk (e.g., \"Latex\"), an allergy or intolerance condition (e.g., \"Latex allergy\"), or a negated/excluded code for a specific substance or class (e.g., \"No latex allergy\") or a general or categorical negated statement (e.g.,  \"No known allergy\", \"No known drug allergies\").
  Comments = It is strongly recommended that this element be populated using a terminology, where possible. For example, some terminologies used include RxNorm, SNOMED CT, DM+D, NDFRT, ICD-9, IDC-10, UNI, ATC and CPT. Plain text should only be used if there is no appropriate terminology available. Additional details can be specified in the text.\r\rWhen a substance or product code is specified for the \'code\' element, the \"default\" semantic context is that this is a positive statement of an allergy or intolerance (depending on the value of the \'type\' element, if present) condition to the specified substance/product.  In the corresponding SNOMED CT allergy model, the specified substance/product is the target (destination) of the \"Causative agent\" relationship.\r\rThe \'substanceExposureRisk\' extension is available as a structured and more flexible alternative to the \'code\' element for making positive or negative allergy or intolerance statements.  This extension provides the capability to make \"no known allergy\" (or \"no risk of adverse reaction\") statements regarding any coded substance/product (including cases when a pre-coordinated \"no allergy to x\" concept for that substance/product does not exist).  If the \'substanceExposureRisk\' extension is present, the AllergyIntolerance.code element SHALL be omitted.

For instance, it may be a more specific substance (e.g. a brand medication) or a composite product that includes the identified substance. It must be clinically safe to only process the \'code\' and ignore the \'reaction.substance\'.

The \'code\' element allows for the use of a specific substance or pharmaceutical product, or a group or class of substances. In the case of an allergy or intolerance to a class of substances, (for example, \"penicillins\"), the \'reaction.substance\' element could be used to code the specific substance that was identifed as having caused the reaction (for example, \"amoxycillin\"). Duplication of the value in the \'code\' and \'reaction.substance\' elements is acceptable when a specific substance has been recorded in \'code\'.
