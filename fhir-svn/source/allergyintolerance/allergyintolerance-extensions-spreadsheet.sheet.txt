  Binding Name = SubstanceCode
  Binding = value set
  Reference = http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/substance-code
  Definition = Codes defining the type of the substance (including pharmaceutical products).
  Conformance = example

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Binding Name = AllergyIntoleranceSubstanceExposureRisk
  Binding = code list
  Reference = #allerg-intol-substance-exp-risk
  Definition = The risk of an adverse reaction (allergy or intolerance) for this patient upon exposure to the substance (including pharmaceutical products).
  Conformance = required

 -- Row 3 -----------------------------------
  Binding Name = AllergyIntoleranceCertainty
  Binding = code list
  Reference = #reaction-event-certainty
  Definition = Statement about the degree of clinical certainty that a specific substance was the cause of the manifestation in a reaction event.
  Conformance = required

=== Sheet allerg-intol-substance-exp-risk =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Id = 1
  Code = known-reaction-risk
  Display = Known Reaction Risk
  Definition = Known risk of allergy or intolerance reaction upon exposure to the specified substance.

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Id = 2
  Code = no-known-reaction-risk

  Definition = No known risk of allergy or intolerance reaction upon exposure to the specified substance.

=== Sheet reaction-event-certainty =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Id = 1
  Code = unlikely
  Display = Unlikely
  Definition = There is a low level of clinical certainty that the reaction was caused by the identified substance.

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Id = 2

 -- Row 3 -----------------------------------
  Id = 3
  Code = confirmed
  Display = Confirmed

 -- Row 4 -----------------------------------
  Id = 4
  Code = unknown
  Display = Unknown
  Definition = The clinical certainty that the reaction was caused by the identified substance is unknown.  It is an explicit assertion that certainty is not known.
