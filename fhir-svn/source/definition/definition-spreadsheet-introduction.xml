<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
This is <b>NOT</b> a resource.  It is not part of the FHIR schema and cannot appear directly in FHIR instances.  It is a logical model that defines a pattern adhered to by
other resources.  This pattern serves two purposes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>It offers guidance to work groups designing resources and helps ensure consistency of content created by different work groups</li>
  <li>It provides a standard "view" that might be useful for implementers in processing and manipulating all resources that adhere to the same pattern.  (Tooling that supports
  this may become available in a future release.)</li>
</ul>
<p>
A "definition" resource is a resource that describes a type of activity that *can* occur in a manner that is independent of a particular patient or subject.  Examples include 
protocols, order sets, questionnaires, etc.  It only includes definitions of activities, not of objects or roles.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
This logical model is one of three common <a href="workflow.html#respatterns">workflow patterns</a>.  The other two patterns are <a href="event.html">Event</a> and
<a href="request.html">Request</a>.  This pattern is followed by (or is intended to be followed by a number of <a href="workflow.html#list">other FHIR resources</a>/
</p>
<p>
Both definitions and <a href="request.html">requests</a> deal with activities that "can" occur, but requests represent a specific intention for something to occur and are bound to
a specific context of subject and time, while definitions represent mere "possibility" rather than intention and are independent of a specific subject or timeframe.
</p>

</div>

<div>
<h2>Background and Context</h2>
<p>
This model represents a pattern.  It provides a standard list of data elements with cardinalities, data types, definitions, rationale and usage notes that will ideally be 
adhered to by resources that fall into the "definition" workflow category.  However, adherence to this pattern is not mandatory.  Not all healthcare domains are the same.
Concepts that may be generally applicable (and thus are included in this standard pattern) might still not be relevant everywhere or may be sufficiently uncommon that they
are more appropriate to include as extensions than as core properties of the resource.  Work groups are encouraged to adjust descriptions, usage notes and rationale to be
specific to their resource (e.g. use the term "protocol" or "questionnaire" rather than "definition").  As well, design notes in the comments column marked with [square
brackets] identifies areas where domain variation is expected and encouraged.  Other variation, including differences in names, cardinalities, data types and the decision to
omit an element outright are also possible, but should be discussed with the FHIR Infrastructure work group's Workflow project to ensure the rationale for non-alignment is
understood, to confirm that the deviation is necessary and to identify whether any adjustments to the pattern are appropriate.
</p>
<p>
Unlike the request and event patterns, this pattern has not yet been formally reviewed, nor applied to any of its candidate resources.  It should therefore be treated as a
draft for comment.  Alignment with this pattern (and the content of the pattern) will be discussed by work groups as part of ballot reconciliation.
</p>
<p>
This pattern provides a linkage to the <a href="w5.html">W5</a> list of standard data elements.  Resources that adhere to this pattern should ensure their w5 mappings are
consistent, as is their data element ordering.
