<h2>Narrative</h2>

<p>
Any resource that is a <a href="domainresource.html">DomainResource</a> (almost all types
of resource) may include a human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource,
and may be used to represent the content of the resource to a human.
</p>
<p>
If narrative is present with a status other than 'empty', it SHALL reflect all content
needed for a human to understand the essential clinical and business information for
the resource.  In other words, it must be safe to render only the narrative of the resource without
displaying any of the resource's discrete/encoded information.  Resource definitions and/or
profiles on resources may define what content should be represented in the narrative to
ensure clinical safety.
</p>
<p>
The narrative for a resource can contain additional information that is not in
the structured data, including human-edited content. Such additional information SHALL be
in the scope of the definition of the resource, though it is common for the narrative to
include additional descriptive information extracted from other referenced resources
when describing references. Narrative for a resource should include summary information
about any referenced resources that would be required for a consumer of the resource to
be able to understand the key, essential information about a resource without retrieving
any additional resources.
</p>
<p>
For example, the narrative for a MedicationRequest might include brief summary information
about the referenced patient, prescriber and medication.  Some resources (e.g. List, Composition)
may provide specific rules about what content must (or must not) be included in the resource narrative.
Consideration  should be given to the fact that referenced resources may be updated without updating
referencing resources, so the proportion of content of a referenced resource included
in a referencing resource should be limited.
Systems MAY choose how narrative is generated, including how much de-referencing to
perform, but SHALL NOT assume that the resource is rendered in any particular context
when generating narrative, since resources will be used in multiple contexts.
</p>
<p>
Resources SHOULD always contain narrative to support human-consumption
as a fallback.  Structured data SHOULD NOT generally contain information of
importance to human readers that is omitted from the narrative. Creators of FHIR
resources should not assume that systems will render (or that humans will see)
data that is not in the narrative. However, in strictly managed trading systems
where all systems share a common data model and additional text is unnecessary or
even a clinical safety risk, the narrative may be omitted. Implementers should
give careful consideration before doing this, as it will mean that such resources can
only be understood in the limited trading environment. Closed trading partner
environments are very likely to open up during the lifetime of the resources
they define. Also, many workflow steps involving finding and aggregating
resources are much more difficult or tedious if the resources involved do not have
their own text.
</p>
<p>
In some cases, a resource may only have text with little or no additional discrete data
(as long as all minOccurs=1 elements are satisfied).  This may be necessary for data from
legacy systems where information is captured as a "text blob" or where text is additionally
entered raw or narrated and encoded in formation is added later.
</p>
<p>
Note that <a href="references.html#contained">contained</a> Resources SHALL NOT have a narrative
of their own.
</p>
<p>
The narrative is an XHTML fragment with a flag to indicate its relationship to the data:
</p>
[%dt Narrative 1%]
<a name="security"> </a>
<p>
The contents of the <i>div</i> element are an XHTML fragment that SHALL contain only the basic HTML formatting elements described in
chapters 7-11 (except section 4 of chapter 9) and 15 of the HTML 4.0 standard, &lt;a&gt; elements (either name or href),
images and internally contained style attributes.
The XHTML content SHALL NOT contain
a <code>head</code>, a <code>body</code> element, external stylesheet references, deprecated elements, scripts, forms, base/link/xlink, frames, iframes, objects or event related attributes (e.g. <code>onClick</code>).
This is to ensure that the content of the narrative is contained within the resource and that there is no active content.  Such content would introduce
<a href="security.html#narrative">security issues</a> and potentially safety issues with regard to extracting text from the XHTML.
</p>
<p>
The div element SHALL have some non-whitespace content (text or an image).
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="xml" fragment="Narrative">
  &lt;narrative&gt;
    &lt;div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;This is a simple
          example with only plain text&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/narrative&gt;

   &lt;narrative&gt;
   &lt;div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;
     &lt;p&gt;
       This is an &lt;i&gt;example&lt;/i&gt; with some &lt;b&gt;xhtml&lt;/b&gt; formatting.
     &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/narrative&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p>
The inner portion of the <code>div</code> content is often used for the <i>innerHTML</i> property in a browser.
In order to simplify this kind of processing, when the narrative is represented in JSON,
it SHALL be encoded so that the characters between the first '&gt;' and the last
'&lt;' delimiters is the content of the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element; e.g.
</p>
<pre class="json">
  &quot;div&quot;: &quot;&lt;div&gt;text&lt;/div&gt;&quot;
</pre>
<p>
is legal, but this is not:
</p>
<pre class="json">
  &quot;div&quot;: &quot;&lt;?xml ...&gt;&lt;div&gt;text&lt;/div&gt;&quot;
</pre>
<p>
Note that the XHTML is contained in general XML so there is no support for HTML entities
like <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> or <code>&amp;copy;</code> etc. Unicode characters SHALL be used instead. Unicode
<code>&amp;#160;</code> substitutes for <code>&amp;nbsp;</code>.
</p>
<p>
The narrative content SHOULD be in the <a href="resource-definitions.html#Resource.language">language of the resource</a>, but
there is no reason to expect that HTML type tooling would understand the resource <a href="resource.html#content">language</a> element. For this reason,
a <code>lang</code> attribute on the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> SHOULD also be used (see
<a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/dom.html#the-lang-and-xml:lang-attributes">the note in the HTML 5 specification about use of language</a>).
</p>


<a name="id"> </a>
<h3>Image References</h3>

<p>
Image source data (the <code>src</code> attribute) may refer to an image found in the resource
(as a contained <a href="media.html">Media</a> or <a href="binary.html">Binary</a> resource)
by its <i>id</i>:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="xml" fragment="Patient">
&lt;Patient xmlns=&quot;http://hl7.org/fhir&quot;&gt;
  &lt;text&gt;
    &lt;status value=&quot;generated&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;div xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;... &lt;img src=&quot;#pic1&quot;/&gt;. ....&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/text&gt;
  &lt;contained&gt;
    &lt;Binary&gt;&lt;id value=&quot;pic1&quot;/&gt;&lt;contentType value=&quot;image/gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;content value=&quot;MEKH....SD/Z&quot;/&gt;&lt;/Binary&gt;
  &lt;/contained&gt;
&lt;/Patient&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p>
References between the narrative and the resource data (in either direction)
are mediated by the XML <code>id</code>/<code>idref</code> attributes. in JSON, the property "id" is
used which is equivalent to the XML attribute "id".
</p>
<p>
The <code>id</code> attribute SHALL have a unique value <em>within the resource</em>
with regard to any other id attributes: the uniqueness and resolution
scope of these id references is within the resource that contains them.
Contained resources are included in the id uniqueness scope of the
resource that contains them.
</p>
<p>
If multiple resources are combined into a single combined document,
such as a <a href="bundle.html">Bundle</a>, duplicate
values of the <code>id</code> attribute may occur between resources.
This SHALL be managed by applications reading the resources.
</p>
<p>
Since images that are not contained in the resource cannot be guaranteed to be available
when the resource is presented to a user, the source for any images that are an essential
part of the narrative SHOULD always be embedded as a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2397">data: url</a>,
in an attachment or a contained resource.
</p>

<a name="css"> </a>
<h3>Styling the XHTML</h3>
<p>
The XHTML fragment in the narrative may be styled using cascading stylesheets with
either external or internal styles. External styles are applied using the <i>class</i>
and <i>id</i> attributes on the XHTML elements and internal styles are applied using
a <i>style</i> attribute on the XHTML elements directly.
</p>
<p>
In order to minimise manageability and security issues, authoring systems cannot
specify the CSS stylesheet to use directly. Instead, the application that displays
the resource provides the stylesheets. This means that the rendering system
chooses what styles can be used, but the authoring system must use them in advance.
Authoring systems can use these classes, which SHALL be supported by all rendering systems:
</p>
<table>
 <tr> <td>bold</td> <td>Bold</td> <td>{ font-weight: bold }</td> </tr>
 <tr> <td>italics</td> <td>Italics Text</td> <td>{ font-style: italic }</td> </tr>
 <tr> <td>underline</td> <td>Underlined Text</td> <td>{ text-decoration: underline }</td> </tr>
 <tr> <td>strikethrough</td> <td>Strikethrough Text</td> <td>{ text-decoration: line-through }</td> </tr>
 <tr> <td>left</td> <td>Left Aligned</td> <td>{ text-align : left }</td> </tr>
 <tr> <td>right</td> <td>Right Aligned</td> <td>{ text-align : right }</td> </tr>
 <tr> <td>center</td> <td>Center Aligned</td> <td>{ text-align : center }</td> </tr>
 <tr> <td>justify</td> <td>Justified</td> <td>{ text-align : justify }</td> </tr>
 <tr> <td>border-left</td> <td>Border on the left</td> <td>{ border-left: 1px solid grey }</td> </tr>
 <tr> <td>border-right</td> <td>Border on the right</td> <td>{ border-right: 1px solid grey }</td> </tr>
 <tr> <td>border-top</td> <td>Border on the top</td> <td>{ border-top: 1px solid grey }</td> </tr>
 <tr> <td>border-bottom</td> <td>Border on the bottom</td> <td>{ border-bottom: 1px solid grey }</td> </tr>
 <tr> <td>arabic</td> <td>List is ordered using Arabic numerals: 1, 2, 3</td> <td>{ list-style-type: decimal }</td> </tr>
 <tr> <td>little-roman</td> <td>List is ordered using little Roman numerals: i, ii, iii</td> <td>{ list-style-type: lower-roman }</td> </tr>
 <tr> <td>big-roman</td> <td>List is ordered using big Roman numerals: I, II, III</td> <td>{ list-style-type: upper-roman }</td> </tr>
 <tr> <td>little-alpha</td> <td>List is ordered using little alpha characters: a, b, c</td> <td>{ list-style-type: lower-alpha }</td> </tr>
 <tr> <td>big-alpha</td> <td>List is ordered using big alpha characters: A, B, C</td> <td>{ list-style-type: upper-alpha }</td> </tr>
 <tr> <td>disc</td> <td>List bullets are simple solid discs</td> <td>{ list-style-type: disc }</td> </tr>
 <tr> <td>circle</td> <td>List bullets are hollow discs</td> <td>{ list-style-type : circle }</td> </tr>
 <tr> <td>square</td> <td>List bullets are solid squares</td> <td>{ list-style-type: square }</td> </tr>
 <tr> <td>unlist</td> <td>List with no bullets</td> <td>{ list-style-type: none }</td> </tr>
</table>
<p>
Note: for testing purposes, there is an <a href="basic-example-narrative.xml.html">example resource</a> that includes
all of these styles. It is also available <a href="narrative-example.html">as XHTML</a> and a
<a href="fhir-runtime.css">standard stylesheet</a> that includes all of these styles.  Use of styles
not on this list will require an arrangement between producing and consuming systems.
</p>

<p>
Authoring systems may refer to additional classes, but cannot rely on the fact
that they will be supported. If the additional classes are critical for safe
rendering, trading partner agreements will be required.
</p>
<p>
Authoring systems may also use internal styles using the <i>style</i> attribute. This
has the advantage of not depending on external interpretation, but also has the
side effect of making content more difficult to manage when rendering, so applications
should use this approach with care.
</p>
<p>
Authoring systems may fix the following styling aspects of the content:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>bold, italic, underline, strikethrough</li>
  <li>font color, family and size</li>
  <li>background color, text alignment</li>
  <li>whitespace interpretation</li>
  <li>ordered list number format (since it may be referred to in text)</li>
</ul>
<p>
These style properties are specified in-line using the <code>style</code> attribute. Rendering systems
SHOULD respect any of these rendering styles when they are specified in the <code>style</code>
attribute, although appropriate interpretation is allowed in certain contexts (e.g. a low-contrast display for dark
rooms or a high-contrast display for the visually impaired may adjust colors accordingly).
</p>
<p>
Note that rendering systems can ignore or override any of the internal or
external styles described above, but SHOULD be careful to ensure that this is only done
in the context of well-maintained trading partner agreements, as altering the presentation
of the text may create clinical safety issues.
</p>
<p>
Authors MAY specify additional styles and style properties as specified in the CSS specification,
but these are extensions to this specification and renderers are not required to heed them.
It SHOULD be safe to view the narrative without these additional styling features available.
</p>
<p>
Note that there are additional rules around styling for <a href="documents.html#css">documents</a> presentation.
</p>

<a name="safety"> </a>
<h3>Clinical Safety Concerns</h3>
<p>
Health care records are often associated with legislative and business requirements for very long retention
times (up to a century), and extreme risk aversion with regards to inconsistent display across
a variety of devices. Although the narrative is allowed to use the standard XHTML and CSS
features as described above, implementations are encouraged to show restraint when using the
features available. Even when trading partner arrangements limit the current requirements
made on a system, experience shows that these trading arrangements will likely broaden
over time.
</p>
<p>
In particular:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>complex layered layouts requiring careful testing of
the match between the XHTML <code>div</code> and <code>span</code> elements and styles, and
those that include nested tables (possibly with images) as well, make rendering consistency
difficult, and implementations SHOULD avoid these</li>
 <li>The use of styles e.g. bolding, italics and color; SHOULD NOT be used as the
   sole way to convey meaning or semantics, but should be used in conjunction with other
   data elements to ensure consistent, long term interoperability. </li>
</ul>
