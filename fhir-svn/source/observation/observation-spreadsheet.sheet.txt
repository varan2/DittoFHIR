Comments: Indirect characteristics may be those of a specimen, fetus, donor,  other observer (for example a relative or EMT), or any observation made about the subject.
  Requirements = Observations have no value if you don\'t know who or what they\'re about.
  Comments = One would expect this element to be a cardinality  of 1..1.  The only circumstance in which the subject can be missing is when the observation is made by a device that does not know the patient. In this case, the observation SHALL be matched to a patient through some context/channel matching technique, and at this point, the observation should be updated.\r\rIf the target of the observation is different than the subject, the general extension [observation-focal-subject](extension-observation-focal-subject.html).  may be used.  However, the distinction between the patient\'s own value for an observation versus that of the fetus, or the donor or blood product unit, etc., are often specified in the observation code.

  Short Name = Actual result
  Definition = The information determined as a result of making the observation, if the information has a simple value
  Requirements = An observation exists to have a value, though it may not if it is in error, or if it represents a group of observations
  Comments = Normally, an observation will have either a single value or a set of related observations. A few observations (e.g. Apgar score) may have both a value and related observations (for an Apgar score, the observations from which the measure is derived). If a value is present, the datatype for this element should be determined by Observation.code. This element has a variable name depending on the type as follows: valueQuantity, valueCodeableConcept, valueString, valueBoolean, valueRange, valueRatio, valueSampledData, valueAttachment, valueTime, valueDateTime, or valuePeriod. (The name format is \"\'value\' + the type name\" with a capital on the first letter of the type).\r\r\rIf the data element is usually coded or if the type associated with the Observation.value defines a coded value, use CodeableConcept instead of string datatype even if the value is uncoded text.  A value set is bound to the ValueCodeableConcept element.    For further discussion and examples see the  [notes section](observation.html#notes) below.

  Requirements = For many results it is necessary to handle exceptional values in measurements.
  Comments = Null or exceptional values can be represented two ways in FHIR Observations.  One way is to simply include them in the value set and represent the exceptions in the value.  For example, measurement values for a serology test could be  \"detected\", \"not detected\", \"inconclusive\", or  \"specimen unsatisfactory\".   The alternate way is to use the value element for actual observations and use the explicit dataAbsentReason element to record exceptional values.  For example, the dataAbsentReason code \"error\" could be used when the measurement was not completed. Note that an observation may only be reported if there are values to report. For example differential cell counts values may be reported only when > 0.  Because of these options, use-case agreements are required to interpret general observations for null or exceptional values.

  Definition = The information determined as a result of making the observation, if the information has a simple value
  Requirements = An observation exists to have a value, though it may not if it is in error, or if it represents a group of observations
  Comments = Normally, an observation will have either a single value or a set of related observations. A few observations (e.g. Apgar score) may have both a value and related observations (for an Apgar score, the observations from which the measure is derived). If a value is present, the datatype for this element should be determined by Observation.code. A CodeableConcept with just a text would be used instead of a string if the field was usually coded, or if the type associated with the Observation.code defines a coded value.   For boolean values use valueCodeableConcept and select codes from <http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/v2-0136> (these \"yes/no\" concepts can be mapped to the display name \"true/false\" or other mutually exclusive terms that may be needed\").  The element, Observation.value[x], has a variable name depending on the type as follows: valueQuantity, valueCodeableConcept, valueRatio, valueChoice, valuePeriod, valueSampleData, or valueString (the name format is \"\'value\' + the type name\" with a capital on the first letter of the type).

  Definition = Provides a reason why the expected value in the element Observation.component.value[x] is missing.
  Requirements = For many results it is necessary to handle exceptional values in measurements.
  Comments = \"Null\" or exceptional values can be represented two ways in FHIR Observations.  One way is to simply include them in the value set and represent the exceptions in the value.  For example, measurement values for a serology test could be  \"detected\", \"not detected\", \"inconclusive\", or  \"test not done\".   The alternate way is to use the value element for actual observations and use the explicit dataAbsentReason element to record exceptional values.  For example, the dataAbsentReason code \"error\" could be used when the measurement was not completed.  Because of these options, use-case agreements are required to interpret general observations for exceptional values.

  Name = stats
  Use = Resource
  Documentation = The Statistics operation performs a set of statistical calculations on a set of clinical measurements such as a blood pressure as stored on the server.  This operation is focused on [Observation](observation.html) resources with valueQuantity elements that have UCUM unit codes.\n\nThe set of Observations is defined by 4 parameters:\n\n*  the subject of the observations for which the statistics are being generated (`subject`)\n* which observations to generate statistics for (`code` and `system`, or `coding`)\n* the time period over which to generate statistics `\'duration` or `period`)\n* the set of statistical analyses to return (`statistic`)\n\nPossible statistical analyses (see [StatisticsCode](valueset-observation-statistics.html)):\n\n[[[valueset:observation-statistics]]]\n\nIf successful, the operation returns an Observation resource for each code with the results of the statistical calculations as component value pairs where the component code = the statistical code. The Observation also contains the input parameters `patient`,`code` and `duration` parameters. If unsuccessful, an [OperationOutcome](operationoutcome.html) with an error message will be returned.\n\nThe client can request that all the observations on which the statistics are based be returned as well, using the include parameter. If an include parameter is specified, a limit may also be specified; the sources observations are subsetted at the server\'s discretion if count > limit. This functionality is included with the intent of supporting graphical presentation

  Footer = This operation cannot be performed on observations that the user is not authorized to see.  It is assumed that the server has identified and secured the context appropriately, and can either associate the authorization context with a single patient, or determine whether the context has the rights to the nominated patient, if there is one. If there is no nominated patient (e.g. the operation is invoked at the system level) and the context is not associated with a single patient record, then the server should return an error. Specifying the relationship between the context, a user and patient records is outside the scope of this specification.

  Documentation = The *lastn query* meets the common need for searching for the most recent or last n=number of observations for a subject. For example, retrieving the last 5 temperatures for a patient to view trends or fetching the most recent laboratory results or vitals signs. To ask a server to return the last n=number of observations, the *lastn* queryuses the [normal search parameters](observation.html#search) defined for the Observation resource. However, rather than their normal use, they are interpreted as inputs - i.e.. instead of requiring that the resources literally contain the search parameters, they are passed to a server algorithm of some kind that uses them to determine the most appropriate matches.\n\nThe response from an lastn query is a set of observations: \n\n*  filtered by additional parameters\n* \'GROUP BY\' `Observation.code`\n* sorted from most recent to the oldest\n* limited to the number of requested responses per group specified by the optional max query parameter\n* If no maximum number is given then only the most recent Observation in each group is returned. \n\nThe set of returned observations should represent distinct real world observations and not the same observation with changes in status or versions. If there are no matches, the *lastn* query SHALL return an empty search set with no error, but may include an operation outcome with further advice.
  Type = operation

  Title = Last N Observations Query
  Footer = The key differences between this query operation and simply searching Observation using the combination of `_count` and `_sort` parameters are:\n\n* The *lastn* query returns **only** the last N resource grouped by code.  Using the _count query method doesn\'t restrict the total mathches so you may need to page through several \"A\" Observations  before getting to Observation \"B\".\n* The server is responsible for grouping the observations by codes.  This frees the client from needing to determine which codes she should ask for.\n\nThis operation cannot be performed on observations that the user is not authorized to see.  It is assumed that the server has identified and secured the context appropriately, and can either associate the authorization context with a single patient, or determine whether the context has the rights to the nominated patient, if there is one. If there is no nominated patient (e.g. the operation is invoked at the system level) and the context is not associated with a single patient record, then the server should return an error.
