<h3>Implementation Notes</h3>
<p>
The media resource contains several date/times:
</p>
<ul>
 <li><code>Media.occurrence[x]</code> - The date(/time) of collection, or the period over which collection occured</li>
 <li><code>Media.duration</code> - The duration of the media. The duration might differ from occurrencePeriod if recording was paused</li>
 <li><code><a href="datatypes-definitions.html#Attachment.creation">Media.content.creation</a></code> - This should be consistent with the Media.occurrence[x] but might be different due to partial / edited recordings</li>
</ul>

<p>
This resource can embed the image information directly through the <code>attachment.data</code> element.  
However, good practice is generally to use the <code>attachment.url</code> element to point to a <a href="binary.html">Binary</a> resource.  
Servers will frequently be able to persist Binary resources in purpose-dedicated repositories more suitable to potentially large artifacts.
