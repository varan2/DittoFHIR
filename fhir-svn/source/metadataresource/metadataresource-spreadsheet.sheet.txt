 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Element = MetadataResource
  Card. = 1..1
  UML = 230;160
  Type = DomainResource
  Short Name = Common Ancestor declaration for definitional resources
  Definition = Common Ancestor declaration for conformance and knowledge artifact resources
  w5 = conformance.behavior

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Element = MetadataResource.url
  Card. = 0..1
  Summary = y
  Type = uri
  Short Name = Logical URI to reference this {{title}} (globally unique)
  Definition = An absolute URI that is used to identify this {{title}} when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance. This SHALL be a URL, SHOULD be globally unique, and SHOULD be an address at which this {{title}} is (or will be) published. The URL SHOULD include the major version of the {{title}}. For more information see [Technical and Business Versions](resource.html#versions).
  Requirements = Allows the {{title}} to be referenced by a single globally unique identifier
  Comments = Can be a urn:uuid: or a urn:oid:, but real http: addresses are preferred.  Multiple instances may share the same url if they have a distinct version.
  w5 = id

 -- Row 3 -----------------------------------
  Element = MetadataResource.identifier
  Card. = 0..*
  Summary = y
  Type = Identifier
  Short Name = Additional identifier for the {{title}}
  Definition = A formal identifier that is used to identify this {{title}} when it is represented in other formats, or referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance.
  Requirements = Allows externally provided and/or usable business identifiers to be easily associated with the module
  Comments = Typically, this is used for identifiers that can go in an HL7 V3 II (instance identifier) data type, e.g., to identify this {{title}} outside of FHIR, where it is not possible to use the logical URI
  Object Impl = no-gen-base
  w5 = id

 -- Row 4 -----------------------------------
  Element = MetadataResource.version
  Card. = 0..1
  Summary = y
  Type = string
  Short Name = Business version of the {{title}}
  Definition = The identifier that is used to identify this version of the {{title}} when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or instance. This is an arbitrary value managed by the {{title}} author and is not expected to be globally unique. For example, it might be a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a managed version is not available. There is also no expectation that versions can be placed in a lexicographical sequence
  Comments = There may be different {{title}} instances that have the same identifier but different versions.  The version can be appended to the url in a reference to allow a refrence to a particular business version of the {{title}} with the format [url]|[version]
  w5 = id.version

 -- Row 5 -----------------------------------
  Element = MetadataResource.name
  Card. = 0..1
  Summary = y

  Summary = y
  Type = string
  Short Name = Name for this {{title}} (human friendly)

  Definition = The status of this {{title}}. Enables tracking the life-cycle of the content.
  Comments = Allows filtering of {{title}}s that are appropriate for use vs. not.  \nThis is labeled as \"Is Modifier\" because applications should not use a retired {{title}} without due consideration
  w5 = status

 -- Row 8 -----------------------------------
  Element = MetadataResource.experimental
  Card. = 0..1
  Is Modifier = y
  Summary = y
  Type = boolean
  Short Name = For testing purposes, not real usage
  Definition = A boolean value to indicate that this {{title}} is authored for testing purposes (or education/evaluation/marketing), and is not intended to be used for genuine usage.
  Requirements = Enables experimental content to be developed following the same lifecycle that would be used for a production-level {{title}}
  Comments = Allows filtering of {{title}} that are appropriate for use vs. not. This is labeled as \"Is Modifier\" because applications should not use an experimental {{title}} in production.

  Card. = 0..1
  Aliases = Revision Date
  Summary = y
  Type = dateTime
  Short Name = Date this was last changed
  Definition = The date  (and optionally time) when the {{title}} was published. The date must change if and when the business version changes and it must change if the status code changes. In addition, it should change when the substantive content of the {{title}} changes.
  Comments = Note that this is not the same as the resource last-modified-date, since the resource may be a secondary representation of the {{title}}. Additional specific dates may be added as extensions or be found by consulting Provenances associated with past versions of the resource.
  w5 = when.recorded

 -- Row 10 -----------------------------------
  Element = MetadataResource.publisher
  Card. = 0..1
  Summary = y
  Type = string
  Short Name = Name of the publisher (organization or individual)
  Definition = The name of the individual or organization that published the {{title}}.
  Requirements = Helps establish the \"authority/credibility\" of the {{title}}.  May also allow for contact
  Comments = Usually an organization, but may be an individual. The publisher (or steward) of the {{title}} is the organization or individual primarily responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of the {{title}}. This is not necessarily the same individual or organization that developed and initially authored the content. The publisher is the primary point of contact for questions or issues with the {{title}}. This item SHOULD be populated unless the information is available from context.

  Comments = This description can be used to capture details such as why the {{title}} was built, comments about misuse, instructions for clinical use and interpretation, literature references, examples from the paper world, etc. It is not a rendering of the {{title}} as conveyed in the \'text\' field of the resource itself. This item SHOULD be populated unless the information is available from context (e.g. the language of the profile is presumed to be the predominant language in the place the profile was created).

 -- Row 15 -----------------------------------
  Element = MetadataResource.purpose
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = markdown
  Short Name = Why this {{title}} is defined
  Definition = Explaination of why this {{title}} is needed and why it has been designed as it has.
  Comments = This element does not describe the usage of the {{title}} Instead  it provides traceability of \'\'why\'\' the resource is either needed or \'\'why\'\' it is defined as it is.  This may be used to point to source materials or specifications that drove the structure of this {{title}}.
  Object Impl = no-gen-base

  Comments = The \'date\' element may be more recent than the approval date because of minor changes / editorial corrections.
  Object Impl = no-gen-base

 -- Row 18 -----------------------------------
  Element = MetadataResource.lastReviewDate
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = date
  Short Name = When the {{title}} was last reviewed
  Definition = The date on which the resource content was last reviewed. Review happens periodically after approval, but doesn\'t change the original approval date.
  Requirements = Gives a sense of how \"current\" the content is.  Resources that have not been reviewed in a long time may have a risk of being less appropriate/relevant.
  Comments = If specified, this is usually after the approval date.
  Object Impl = no-gen-base

 -- Row 19 -----------------------------------
  Element = MetadataResource.effectivePeriod
  Card. = 0..1

  Type = Period
  Short Name = When the {{title}} is expected to be used
  Definition = The period during which the {{title}} content was or is planned to be in active use.
  Requirements = Allows establishing a transition before a resource comes into effect and also allows for a sunsetting  process when new versions of a the {{title}} are or are expected to be used instead
  Comments = The effective period for a {{title}}  determines when the content is applicable for usage and is independent of publication and review dates. For example, a measure intended to be used for the year 2016 might be published in 2015.
