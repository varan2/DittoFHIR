<p>These examples illustrate the use of the Library resource to share quality measurement and improvement logic as a FHIR resource. Note that the actual content of each library (the Clinical Quality Language (CQL) source, or the XML for the information model definition, etc.) should be contained in the <code>content</code> element as an <code>Attachment</code>. For illustration purposes, the content of each library is included in its raw form, and linked here.</p>
