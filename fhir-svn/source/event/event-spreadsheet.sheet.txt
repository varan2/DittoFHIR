=== Sheet Bindings =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Binding Name = EventStatus
  Binding = code list
  Reference = #event-status
  Definition = Codes identifying the stage lifecycle stage of a event
  Conformance = required

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Binding Name = EventCode
  Binding = unbound
  Definition = Codes indicating the details of what is/was done.  These will vary significantly based on the type of request resource and will often be example/preferred rather than extensible/required.

 -- Row 3 -----------------------------------
  Binding Name = EventReason
  Binding = unbound
  Definition = Codes identifying why this event was necessary.  These may be clinical reasons (e.g. diagnoses, symptoms) and/or administrative reasons.  While the detailed constraints of relevant reasons will vary by resource, some degree of consistency across resources around recommended codes would be desirable.

 -- Row 4 -----------------------------------
  Binding Name = EventPerformerRole
  Binding = value set
  Reference = http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/performer-role
  Definition = Codes describing the types of functional roles performers can take on when performing events
  Conformance = example

=== Sheet event-status =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Id = 1

 -- Row 6 -----------------------------------
  Id = 6
  Code = entered-in-error
  Display = Entered in Error
  Definition = This electronic record should never have existed, though it is possible that real-world decisions were based on it.  (If real-world activity has occurred, the status should be \"cancelled\" rather than \"entered-in-error\".)
  v3 = =ActStatus.nullified

 -- Row 7 -----------------------------------
  Id = 7
  Code = unknown
  Display = Unknown
  Definition = The authoring system does not know which of the status values currently applies for this request.  Note: This concept is not to be used for \"other\" - one of the listed statuses is presumed to apply, it\'s just not known which one.

  Requirements = Creating a {{title}} where notDone is true is intended for situations where there\'s a need for a specific statement in the record about something not being done.  If the need is merely to indicate that a request wasn\'t fulfilled, that should be handled using Task.
  Comments = The more attributes are populated, the more constrained the negated statement is.  For example if timeframe and performer are specified, that means the event wasn\'t done by that performer in that time-period, but could well have been done by someone else or by that performer in a different time period.
