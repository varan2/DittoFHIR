<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
The <a href="testscript.html">TestScript</a> resource is used to define tests that can be executed on one or more FHIR servers. The TestReport resource defines how systems should encode the summarized results of executing a TestScript.
</p>
<p>
The TestReport structure mirrors the TestScript concepts of having sections for setup, tests, and teardown. If present, these ordered lists should mirror the actions (either operations or assertions) of the referenced TestScript with a result code: pass, skip, fail, warning, or error.
