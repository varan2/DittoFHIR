<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p><strong>This resource is an <em>event</em> resource from a FHIR workflow perspective - see <a href="workflow.html">Workflow</a>.

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
This resource overlaps with others such as <a href="device.html">Device</a> and <a href="medication.html">Medication</a>.
The <b>Supply</b> resource may be used to describe medications and devices when handling them generically (as any other supply).  For
example, when processing bulk orders, etc.  However, when the medication, device or other aspects of the resource are important,
(e.g. in a <a href="medicationrequest.html">MedicationRequest</a> or when identifying a device as a performer), the
more detailed resource must be used.
