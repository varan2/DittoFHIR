The URI is allowed to be relative; in which case, it is relative to the server end-point (since their may be more than one, clients should avoid using relative URIs)\n\nThis address will be to the service base, without any parameters, or sub-services or resources tacked on.\n\nE.g. for a WADO-RS endpoint, the url should be \"https://pacs.hospital.org/wado-rs\"\n\nand not \"https://pacs.hospital.org/wado-rs/studies/1.2.250.1.59.40211.12345678.678910/series/1.2.250.1.59.40211.789001276.14556172.67789/instances/...\"
