  Comments = Default is true. If a record is inactive, and linked to an active record, then future patient/record updates should occur on the other patient\n\nThis element is labeled as a modifier because when the patient record is marked as not active it is not expected to be used/referenced without being changed back to active.

  Definition = A contact detail (e.g. a telephone number or an email address) by which the individual may be contacted.
  Requirements = People have (primary) ways to contact them in some way such as phone, email.
  Comments = A Patient may have multiple ways to be contacted with different uses or applicable periods.  May need to have options for contacting the person urgently and also to help with identification. The address may not go directly to the individual, but may reach another party that is able to proxy for the patient (i.e. home phone, or pet owner\'s phone)

  Definition = Administrative Gender - the gender that the patient is considered to have for administration and record keeping purposes.
  Requirements = Needed for identification of the individual, in combination with (at least) name and birth date. Gender of individual drives many clinical processes.
  Comments = The gender may not match the biological sex as determined by genetics, or the individual\'s preferred identification. Note that for both humans and particularly animals, there are other legitimate possibilities than M and F, though the vast majority of systems and contexts only support M and F.  Systems providing decision support or enforcing business rules should ideally do this on the basis of Observations dealing with the specific gender aspect of interest (anatomical, chromosonal, social, etc.)  However, because these observations are infrequently recorded, defaulting to the administrative gender is common practice.  Where such defaulting occurs, rule enforcement should allow for the variation between administrative and biological, chromosonal and other gender aspects.  For example, an alert about a hysterectomy on a male should be handled as a warning or overrideable error, not a \"hard\" error.

  Definition = Indicates if the individual is deceased or not
  Requirements = The fact that a patient is deceased influences the clinical process. Also, in human communication and relation management it is necessary to know whether the person is alive.
  Comments = If there\'s no value in the instance it means there is no statement on whether or not the individual is deceased. Most systems will interpret the absence of a value as a sign of the person being alive.\n\nThis element is labeled as a modifier because once a patient is marked as deceased, the actions that are appropriate to perform on the patient may be significantly different.

Systems SHALL either handle patient details appropriately (e.g. inform users patient is not human) or reject declared animal records.   The absense of the animal element does not imply that the patient is a human. If a system requires such a positive assertion that the patient is human, an extension will be required.

If you need to convey proficiency for multiple modes then you need multiple Patient.Communication associations.

  Documentation = A Master Patient Index ([MPI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_master_patient_index) ) is a service used to manage patient identification in a context where multiple patient databases exist. Healthcare applications and middleware use the MPI to match patients between the databases, and as new patient details are encountered. MPIs are highly specialized applications, often tailored extensively to the institution\\\'s particular mix of patients. MPIs can also be run on a regional and national basis.\\n\\nTo ask an MPI to match a patient, clients use the \\\"$match\\\" operation, which accepts a patient resource which may be only partially complete. The data provided is interpreted as an MPI input and passed processed by an algorithm of some kind that uses the data to determine the most appropriate matches in the patient set. \\n\\nNote that different MPI matching algorithms have different required inputs. The generic $match operation does not specify any particular algorithm, nor a minimum set of information that must be provided when asking for an MPI match operation to be performed, but may implementations will have a set of minimum information, which may be declared in their definition of the $match operation by specifying a profile on the resource parameter, indicating which properties are required in the search.\\n\\nThe patient resource coming into the operation does not have to be complete, nor does it need to pass validation (i.e. Mandatory fields don\\\'t need to be populated), but it does have to be a valid instance. This is due to the resource being used for reference data to match from, and not being stored.

All patient records SHALL have a search score from 0 to 1, where 1 is the most certain match, along with an extension \"[match-grade](extension-match-grade.html)\" that indicates the MPI\'s position on the match quality.

The server also returns whatever resources are needed to support the records - e.g. linked practitioners, medications, locations, organizations etc. The principle intended use for this operation is to provide a patient with access to their entire record (e.g. \"Blue Button\").  The server SHOULD return at least all resources that it has that are in the patient compartment for the identified patient, and any resource referenced from those, including binaries and attachments. In the US Realm, at a mimimum, the resources returned SHALL include all the data covered by the meaningful use common data elements as defined in [DAF](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/daf). Other applicable implementation guides may make additional rules about how much information that is returned
  Type = operation
  Example.Request = $everything-request.txt
  Example.Response = $everything-response.txt
  Title = Fetch Patient Record
  Footer = The key differences between this operation and simply searching the patient compartment are:  \n\n* unless the client requests otherwise, the server returns the entire result set in a single bundle (rather than using paging) \n* the server is responsible for determining what resources to return as included resources (rather than the client specifying which ones). This frees the client from needing to determine what it could or should ask for\n\nIt is assumed that the server has identified and secured the context appropriately, and can either associate the authorization context with a single patient, or determine whether the context has the rights to the nominated patient, if there is one. If there is no nominated patient (e.g. the operation is invoked at the system level) and the context is not associated with a single patient record, then the server should return an error. Specifying the relationship between the context, a user and patient records is outside the scope of this specification.
