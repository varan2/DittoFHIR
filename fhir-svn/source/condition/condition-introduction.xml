<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>Condition is one of the <a href="workflow.html#event">event</a> resources in the FHIR <a href="workflow.html">workflow</a> specification.</p>

<p>
This resource is used to record detailed information about a condition, problem, diagnosis, or other event, situation, issue, or clinical concept that has risen to a level of concern.  The condition could be a point in time diagnosis in context of an encounter, it could be an item on the practitioner’s Problem List, or it could be a concern that doesn’t exist on the practitioner’s Problem List.  Often times, a condition is about a clinician's assessment and assertion of a particular aspect of a patient's state of health. It can be used to record information about a disease/illness identified from application of clinical reasoning over the pathologic and pathophysiologic findings (diagnosis), or identification of health issues/situations that a practitioner considers harmful, potentially harmful and may be investigated and managed (problem), or other health issue/situation that may require ongoing monitoring and/or management (health issue/concern).
</p>

<p>
The condition resource may be used to record a certain health state of a patient which does not normally present a negative outcome, e.g. pregnancy.  The condition resource may be used to record a condition following a procedure, such as the condition of Amputee-BKA following an amputation procedure.
</p>

<p>
While conditions are frequently a result of a clinician's assessment and assertion of a particular aspect of a patient's state of health, conditions can also be expressed by the patient, related person, or any care team member. A clinician may have a concern about a patient condition (e.g. anorexia) that the patient is not concerned about.  Likewise, the patient may have a condition (e.g. hair loss) that does not rise to the level of importance such that it belongs on a practitioner’s Problem List.
</p>

<p>
For example, each of the following conditions could rise to the level of importance such that it belongs on a problem or concern list due to its direct or indirect impact on the patient’s health.  These examples may also be represented using other resources, such as <a href="familymemberhistory.html">FamilyMemberHistory</a>, <a href="observation.html">Observation</a>, or <a href="procedure.html">Procedure</a>.

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
    The condition resource may be referenced by other resources as "reasons" for an action (e.g. <a href="medicationrequest.html">MedicationRequest</a>,
<a href="procedure.html">Procedure</a>, <a href="procedurerequest.html">ProcedureRequest</a>, etc.)
</p>
<p>
This resource is not typically used to record information about subjective and objective information that might lead to the recording of a Condition resource. Such signs and symptoms are typically captured using the <a href="observation.html">Observation</a> resource;
although in some cases a persistent symptom, e.g. fever, headache may be captured as a condition before a definitive diagnosis can be discerned by a clinician.
</p>
<p>
Use the <a href="observation.html">Observation</a> resource when a symptom is resolved without long term management, tracking, or when a symptom contributes to the establishment of a condition.
</p>
<p>
Use Condition when a symptom requires long term management, tracking, or is used as a proxy for a diagnosis or problem that is not yet determined.
</p>
<p>
When the diagnosis is related to an allergy or intolerance, the Condition and <a href="allergyintolerance.html">AllergyIntolerance</a> resources can both be used.  However, using Condition alone is not sufficient as the allergy or intolerance needs to be represented as an <a href="allergyintolerance.html">AllergyIntolerance</a> to be actionable for decision support
