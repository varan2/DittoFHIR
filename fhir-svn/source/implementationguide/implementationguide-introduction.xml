<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
An implementation guide (IG) is a set of rules about how FHIR resources are used (or should be used) to solve
a particular problem, with associated documentation to support and clarify the usage. Classically, FHIR
implementation guides are published on the web after they are generated using the 
<a href="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=IG_Publisher_Documentation">FHIR Implementation Guide Publisher</a>.
</p>
<p>
The <code>ImplementationGuide</code> resource is a single resource that defines the logical content
of the IG, along with the important entry pages into the publication, so that the 
logical package that the IG represents, so that the contents are computable. 
</p>
<p>
In particular, validators are able to use the ImplementationGuide resource to validate content
against the implementation guide as a whole. The significant conformance expectation introduced 
by the ImplementationGuide resource is the idea of <a href="#default">Default Profiles</a>. 
Implementations may conform to multiple implementation guides at once, but this requires that 
the implementation guides are compatible (see <a href="#compatibility">below</a>).

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
Implementation Guides contain two different types of resource references:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Contents: A set of logical statements which implementations must conform to. These are almost always <a href="conformance-module.html">conformance resources</a></li>
 <li>Examples: Examples that illustrate the intent of the profiles defined in the implementation guide. These can be any kind of resource</li>
</ul>
<p>
An application's <a href="capabilitystatement.html">Capability Statement</a> may identify one or more implementation guides that an application conforms to.
