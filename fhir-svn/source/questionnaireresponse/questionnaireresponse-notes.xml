Notes
</h2>
<ul>
<li>QuestionnaireResponses can be authored by clinicians, patients, or patients' relatives (or even owners in the case of animals). Clinicians
may author questionnaire responses, where the answers are provided by others on behalf of the patient. Additionally, information gathered on behalf of a patient may be about the patient's relatives (e.g. in family anamnesis). Therefore, QuestionnaireResponse makes a distinction between the author,
the subject and the source of information.</li>
<li>A QuestionnaireResponse may be stand-alone or may point to the form that defines the questions in <a href="questionnaire.html">Questionnaire</a>.  In
this second case, the linkage between the questions and groups in the two resources is established using the <code>linkId</code> element.</li>
<li>If a QuestionnaireResponse references a Questionnaire, then the QuestionnaireResponse structure must be consistent with the Questionnaire (i.e. questions must be organized into the same groups, nested questions must still be nested, etc.)</li>
<li>Because of the lack of explicit support for Questionnaires in <a href="https://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=186">HL7 v3</a>, 
<a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=7">CDA</a> Documents frequently used named sections with
Observations to model questionnaires. Such use cases should now utilize the QuestionnaireResponse resource instead.</li>
<li>The QuestionnaireResponse's <i>encounter</i> element can be used to link to the encounter when the questionnaire response was authored. This can be relevant since the
encounter gives context to the answers and can be used to relate information in the QuestionnaireResponse to orders and observations that were done during the same Encounter.</li>
<li>The order of questions within groups, groups within groups and groups within questions is relevant and must be retained for display and capture.</li>
<li>Typically <a href="questionnaire.html">Questionnaire</a> items of type <i>display</i> are not mirrored in a QuestionnaireResponse as the purpose of a
QuestionnaireResponse is to reflect the information entered into the form, not the instructions provided, though questions and group headings are retained to ensure
that the meaning of answers can be interpreted independent of the Questionnaire.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Refer to additional guidance provided in the <a href="questionnaire.html">Questionnaire</a> resource dealing with the design of questionnaires.

Security
</h2>
<p>
QuestionnaireResponse resources can have answers with values of type Attachment.  These attachments will typically be selected by the user answering the questionnaire and
this selection may be done in an uncontrolled environment.  Systems should ensure that the attachment is of the desired type and should take precautions before
rendering or executing any attached content.

<h2>
Access Control
</h2>
<p>
For most resources, the type of information that can be conveyed in the resource is determined by the resource, and the key attributes that
determine the sensitivity level of the information are also known; e.g., drug, observation type, clinical trial randomization status, etc.  However, for QuestionnaireResponse, the
sensitivity of an instance is dependent on what type of Questionnaire it is associated with.  And the data elements that determine that
sensitivity could be the answers to any of the questions.  This makes automatically enforcing access control rules more challenging.  Designers
should take these challenges into account and may need to place stricter access controls around QuestionnaireResponse to ensure that access to
information is not granted improperly.
