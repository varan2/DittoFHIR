  Definition = A structured set of questions and their answers. The questions are ordered and grouped into coherent subsets, corresponding to the structure of the grouping of the questionnaire being responded to
  Requirements = To support structured, hierarchical reporting of data gathered using digital forms and other questionnaires.
  Comments = The QuestionnaireResponse contains enough information about the questions asked and their organization that it can be interpreted somewhat independently from the Questionnaire it is based on.  I.e. You don\'t need access to the Questionnaire in order to extract basic information from a QuestionnaireResponse.
  RIM Mapping = Observation[moodCode=EVN]
  w5 = infrastructure.information

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Element = QuestionnaireResponse.identifier
  Card. = 0..1
  Summary = y

  Definition = The Questionnaire that defines and organizes the questions for which answers are being provided
  Requirements = Needed to allow editing of the questionnaire response in a manner that enforces the constraints of the original form.
  Comments = If a QuestionnaireResponse references a Questionnaire, then the QuestionnaireResponse structure must be consistent with the Questionnaire (i.e. questions must be organized into the same groups, nested questions must still be nested, etc.)

  Definition = The position of the questionnaire response within its overall lifecycle
  Requirements = The information on Questionnaire resources  may possibly be gathered during multiple sessions and altered after considered being finished.
  Comments = This element is labeled as a modifier because the status contains codes that mark the resource as not currently valid
  RIM Mapping = .statusCode (also whether there\'s a revisionControlAct - and possibly mood to distinguish \"in-progress\" from \"published)
  Committee Notes = GF#12315
  w5 = status

 -- Row 7 -----------------------------------
  Element = QuestionnaireResponse.subject
  Card. = 0..1
  Aliases = Patient, Focus
  Summary = y
  Type = Reference(Any)
  Short Name = The subject of the questions
  Definition = The subject of the questionnaire response.  This could be a patient, organization, practitioner, device, etc.  This is who/what the answers apply to, but is not necessarily the source of information.
  Requirements = Allows linking the answers to the individual the answers describe.  May also affect access control.
  Comments = If the Questionnaire declared a subjectType, the resource pointed to by this element must be an instance of one of the listed types.

  w5 = context

 -- Row 9 -----------------------------------
  Element = QuestionnaireResponse.authored
  Card. = 0..1
  Aliases = Date Created, Date published, Date Issued, Date updated
  Summary = y
  Type = dateTime
  Short Name = Date the answers were gathered
  Definition = The date and/or time that this set of answers were last changed
  Requirements = Clinicians need to be able to check the date that the information in the questionnaire was collected, to derive the context of the answers.
  Comments = May be different from the lastUpdateTime of the resource itself, because that reflects when the data was known to the server, not when the data was captured.\n\nThis element is optional to allow for systems that may not know the value, however it SHOULD be populated if possible.

  Definition = Person who received the answers to the questions in the QuestionnaireResponse and recorded them in the system
  Requirements = Need to know who interpreted the subject\'s answers to the questions in the questionnaire, and selected the appropriate options for answers.
  Comments = Mapping a subject\'s answers to multiple choice options and determining what to put in the textual answer is a matter of interpretation.  Authoring by device would indicate that some portion of the questionnaire had been auto-populated.

  Element = QuestionnaireResponse.item
  Card. = 0..*
  UML = 390;40
  Short Name = Groups and questions
  Definition = A group or question item from the original questionnaire for which answers are provided
  Comments = Groups cannot have answers and therefore must nest directly within item. When dealing with questions, nesting must occur within each answer because some questions may have multiple answers (and the nesting occurs for each answer).

  Committee Notes = GF#12071

 -- Row 13 -----------------------------------
  Element = QuestionnaireResponse.item.linkId
  Card. = 1..1
  Type = string
  Short Name = Pointer to specific item from Questionnaire
  Definition = The item from the Questionnaire that corresponds to this item in the QuestionnaireResponse resource.
  Requirements = Items can repeat in the answers, so a direct 1..1 correspondence by position may not exist - requiring correspondence by identifier.

 -- Row 14 -----------------------------------
  Element = QuestionnaireResponse.item.definition
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = uri
  Short Name = ElementDefinition - details for the item
  Definition = A reference to an [[[ElementDefinition]]] that provides the details for the item
  Requirements = A common pattern is to define a set of data elements, and then build multiple different questionnaires for different circumstances to gather the data. This element provides traceability to the common definition
  Comments = The ElementDefinition must be in a [[[StructureDefinition]]], and must have a fragment identifier that identifies the specific data element by its id (Element.id). E.g. http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Observation#Observation.value[x].\n\nThere is no need for this element if the item pointed to by the linkId has a definition listed

  Card. = 0..1
  Type = Reference(Any)
  Short Name = The subject this group\'s answers are about
  Definition = More specific subject this section\'s answers are about, details the subject given in QuestionnaireResponse
  Requirements = Sometimes a group of answers is about a specific participant, artifact or piece of information in the patient\'s care or record, e.g. a specific Problem, RelatedPerson, Allergy etc.

  Binding = QuestionnaireAnswer
  Short Name = Single-valued answer to the question
  Definition = The answer (or one of the answers) provided by the respondent to the question
  Requirements = Ability to retain a single-valued answer to a question
  Comments = More complex structures (Attachment, Resource and Quantity) will typically be limited to electronic forms that can expose an appropriate user interface to capture the components and enforce the constraints of a complex data type.  Additional complex types can be introduced through extensions.
  RIM Mapping = .item

 -- Row 19 -----------------------------------
  Element = QuestionnaireResponse.item.answer.item
  Card. = 0..*
  Type = @QuestionnaireResponse.item
  Short Name = Nested groups and questions
