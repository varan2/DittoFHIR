=== Sheet Data Elements =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Element = GuidanceResponse
  Type = DomainResource
  Short Name = The formal response to a guidance request
  Definition = A guidance response is the formal response to a guidance request, including any output parameters returned by the evaluation, as well as the description of any proposed actions to be taken
  w5 = clinical.general

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Element = GuidanceResponse.requestId
  Card. = 0..1
  Summary = Y
  Type = id
  Short Name = The id of the request associated with this response, if any
  Definition = The id of the request associated with this response. If an id was given as part of the request, it will be reproduced here to enable the requester to more easily identify the response in a multi-request scenario

 -- Row 3 -----------------------------------
  Element = GuidanceResponse.identifier
  Card. = 0..1
  Summary = Y
  Type = Identifier
  Short Name = Business identifier
  Definition = Allows a service to provide a unique, business identifier for the response
  w5 = id

 -- Row 4 -----------------------------------
  Element = GuidanceResponse.module
  Card. = 1..1
  Summary = Y
  Type = Reference(ServiceDefinition)
  Short Name = A reference to a knowledge module
  Definition = A reference to the knowledge module that was invoked

 -- Row 5 -----------------------------------
  Element = GuidanceResponse.status
  Card. = 1..1
  Is Modifier = Y
  Summary = Y
  Type = code
  Binding = GuidanceResponseStatus
  Short Name = success | data-requested | data-required | in-progress | failure | entered-in-error
  Definition = The status of the response. If the evaluation is completed successfully, the status will indicate success. However, in order to complete the evaluation, the engine may require more information. In this case, the status will be data-required, and the response will contain a description of the additional required information. If the evaluation completed successfully, but the engine determines that a potentially more accurate response could be provided if more data was available, the status will be data-requested, and the response will contain a description of the additional requested information
  Comments = This element is labeled as a modifier because the status contains codes that mark the resource as not currently valid
  w5 = status

 -- Row 6 -----------------------------------
  Element = GuidanceResponse.subject
  Card. = 0..1

  Element = GuidanceResponse.context
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = Reference(Encounter | EpisodeOfCare)
  Short Name = Encounter or Episode during which the response was returned
  Definition = Allows the context of the guidance response to be provided if available. In a service context, this would likely be unavailable
  w5 = context

 -- Row 8 -----------------------------------
  Element = GuidanceResponse.occurrenceDateTime
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = dateTime
  Short Name = When the guidance response was processed
  Definition = Indicates when the guidance response was processed
  w5 = when.done

 -- Row 9 -----------------------------------
  Element = GuidanceResponse.performer
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = Reference(Device)
  Short Name = Device returning the guidance
  Definition = Provides a reference to the device that performed the guidance
  w5 = who.actor

 -- Row 10 -----------------------------------
  Element = GuidanceResponse.reason[x]
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = CodeableConcept | Reference(Any)
  Short Name = Reason for the response
  Definition = Indicates the reason the request was initiated. This is typically provided as a parameter to the evaluation and echoed by the service, although for some use cases, such as subscription- or event-based scenarios, it may provide an indication of the cause for the response
  w5 = why

 -- Row 11 -----------------------------------
  Element = GuidanceResponse.note
  Card. = 0..*
  Type = Annotation
  Short Name = Additional notes about the response
  Definition = Provides a mechanism to communicate additional information about the response

 -- Row 12 -----------------------------------
  Element = GuidanceResponse.evaluationMessage
  Card. = 0..*
  Type = Reference(OperationOutcome)
  Short Name = Messages resulting from the evaluation of the artifact or artifacts
  Definition = Messages resulting from the evaluation of the artifact or artifacts. As part of evaluating the request, the engine may produce informational or warning messages. These messages will be provided by this element

 -- Row 13 -----------------------------------
  Element = GuidanceResponse.outputParameters
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = Reference(Parameters)
  Short Name = The output parameters of the evaluation, if any
  Definition = The output parameters of the evaluation, if any. Many modules will result in the return of specific resources such as procedure or communication requests that are returned as part of the operation result. However, modules may define specific outputs that would be returned as the result of the evaluation, and these would be returned in this element

 -- Row 14 -----------------------------------
  Element = GuidanceResponse.result
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = Reference(CarePlan|RequestGroup)
  Short Name = Proposed actions, if any
  Definition = The actions, if any, produced by the evaluation of the artifact

 -- Row 15 -----------------------------------
  Element = GuidanceResponse.dataRequirement
  Card. = 0..*
  Type = DataRequirement
  Short Name = Additional required data
  Definition = If the evaluation could not be completed due to lack of information, or additional information would potentially result in a more accurate response, this element will a description of the data required in order to proceed with the evaluation. A subsequent request to the service should include this data

=== Sheet Search =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Name = patient
  Type = reference
  Description = The identity of a patient to search for guidance response results
  Path = GuidanceResponse.subject
  Target Types = Patient

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
