=== Sheet Bindings =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Binding Name = ProvenanceHistoryRecordActivity
  Binding = value set
  Reference = valueset-provenance-history-record-activity
  Definition = Types of activities that are relevant for tracking event history using Provenance
  Conformance = extensible

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Binding Name = ProvenanceHistoryAgentRole
  Binding = value set
  Reference = valueset-provenance-history-agent-role
  Definition = Types of roles that agents can play when tracking event history using Provenance
  Conformance = extensible

=== Sheet provenance-relevant-history-Inv =====================================

=== Sheet provenance-relevant-history =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Element = Provenance
  Type = DomainResource

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Element = Provenance.target
  Must Support = Y
  Short Name = Resource version
  Definition = This points to the version of the resource that was created as a result of this historical record action.  Typically only a single resource will be referenced, but if the same action is performed to multiple resources in the context of a transaction, some systems may link multiple resource instances.
  Comments = The reference SHALL be version-specific

 -- Row 3 -----------------------------------
  Element = Provenance.period
  Must Support = Y
  Definition = This indicates the time the resource action (creation, revision, deletion, etc.) occurred
  Comments = Both low and high will be set to the time the record event occurred.  (In a future version, this element will likely be a choice with dateTime so that multiple values aren\'t needed.)

 -- Row 4 -----------------------------------
  Element = Provenance.reason
  Must Support = Y
  Comments = Plain text reasons can be sent in the \"text\" component with no codings.  Domains may wish to define a constrained terminology.

 -- Row 5 -----------------------------------
  Element = Provenance.activity
  Card. = 1..1
  Must Support = Y
  Binding = ProvenanceHistoryRecordActivity
  Short Name = Record activity
  Definition = Indicates what action occurred to the referenced resource.
  Comments = This should be captured at a sufficiently useful level of granularity.  For example \"suspended\" is more useful than \"updated\".  Domains will need to map the listed codes to their own state transitions and may wish to define additional domain-specific fine-grained codes.
