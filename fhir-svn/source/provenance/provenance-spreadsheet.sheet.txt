 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Element = Provenance
  Aliases = History; Event; Activity
  UML = 0;0
  Type = DomainResource
  Short Name = Who, What, When for a set of resources
  Definition = Provenance of a resource is a record that describes entities and processes involved in producing and delivering or otherwise influencing that resource. Provenance provides a critical foundation for assessing authenticity, enabling trust, and allowing reproducibility. Provenance assertions are a form of contextual metadata and can themselves become important records with their own provenance. Provenance statement indicates clinical significance in terms of confidence in authenticity, reliability, and trustworthiness, integrity, and stage in lifecycle (e.g. Document Completion - has the artifact been legally authenticated), all of which may impact security, privacy, and trust policies.
  Comments = Some parties may be duplicated between the target resource and its provenance.  For instance, the prescriber is usually (but not always) the author of the prescription resource. This resource is defined with close consideration for W3C Provenance

  Comments = Target references are usually version specific, but may not be, if a version has not been assigned or if the provenance information is part of the set of resources being maintained (i.e. a document). When using the RESTful API, the identity of the resource may not be known (especially not the version specific one); the client may either submit the resource first, and then the provenance, or it may submit both using a single transaction. See the notes on transaction for further discussion

  Short Name = Entity is attributed to this agent
  Definition = The entity is attributed to an agent to express the agent\'s responsibility for that entity, possibly along with other agents. This description can be understood as shorthand for saying that the agent was responsible for the activity which generated the entity
  Comments = A usecase where one Provenance.entity.agent is used where the Entity that was used in the creation/updating of the Target, is not in the context of the same custodianship as the Target, and thus the meaning of Provenance.entity.agent is to say that the entity referenced is managed elsewhere and that this Agent provided access to it.  This would be similar to where the Entity being referenced is managed outside FHIR, such as through HL7 v2, v3, or XDS. This might be where the Entity being referenced is managed in another FHIR resource server. Thus it explains the Provenance of that Entity\'s use in the context of this Provenance activity.
