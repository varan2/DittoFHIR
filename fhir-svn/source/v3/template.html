<h1>HL7 v3 Namespaces (Code Systems and Value Sets)</h1>

<p>
These namespaces are defined for use in FHIR. Code Systems are used 
when representing codes that were defined as part of the <a href="https://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=186">HL7 v3</a> code systems. 
So if you are representing the code "M" from
the code system AdministrativeGender in a FHIR instance, then you would use 
the system "http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/AdministrativeGender" (note that the namespace
is case sensitive).
</p>
<p>
Value Set namespaces are used as part of the specification itself, or in 
Profiles or other Value Sets where <a href="https://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=186">HL7 v3</a> code systems are used.
</p>
<p>
All of these namespaces are subject to further change.
