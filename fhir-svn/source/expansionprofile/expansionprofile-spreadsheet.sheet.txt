=== Sheet Bindings =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Binding Name = ConceptDesignationUse
  Binding = value set
  Reference = valueset-designation-use
  Definition = Details of how a designation would be used.

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Binding Name = SystemVersionProcessingMode
  Binding = code list
  Reference = #system-version-processing-mode
  Definition = How to manage the intersection between a fixed version in a value set, and a fixed version of the system in the expansion profile

=== Sheet system-version-processing-mode =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Id = 1
  Code = default
  Display = Default Version
  Definition = Use this version of the code system if a value set doesn\'t specify a version

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Id = 2
  Code = check
  Display = Check ValueSet Version
  Definition = Use this version of the code system. If a value set specifies a different version, the expansion operation should fail

 -- Row 3 -----------------------------------
  Id = 3
  Code = override
  Display = Override ValueSet Version
  Definition = Use this version of the code system irrespective of which version is specified by a value set. Note that this has obvious safety issues, in that it may result in a value set expansion giving a different list of codes that is both wrong and unsafe, and implementers should only use this capability reluctantly. It primarily exists to deal with situations where specifications have fallen into decay as time passes. If a  version is override, the version used SHALL explicitly be represented in the expansion parameters
