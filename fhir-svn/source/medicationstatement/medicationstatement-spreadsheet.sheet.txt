=== Sheet Data Elements =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Element = MedicationStatement
  Type = DomainResource
  Short Name = Record of medication being taken by a patient
  Definition = A record of a medication that is being consumed by a patient.   A MedicationStatement may indicate that the patient may be taking the medication now, or has taken the medication in the past or will be taking the medication in the future.  The source of this information can be the patient, significant other (such as a family member or spouse), or a clinician.  A common scenario where this information is captured is during the history taking process during a patient visit or stay.   The medication information may come from sources such as the patient\'s memory, from a prescription bottle,  or from a list of medications the patient, clinician or other party maintains \r\rThe primary difference between a medication statement and a medication administration is that the medication administration has complete administration information and is based on actual administration information from the person who administered the medication.  A medication statement is often, if not always, less specific.  There is no required date/time when the medication was administered, in fact we only know that a source has reported the patient is taking this medication, where details such as time, quantity, or rate or even medication product may be incomplete or missing or less precise.  As stated earlier, the medication statement information may come from the patient\'s memory, from a prescription bottle or from a list of medications the patient, clinician or other party maintains.  Medication administration is more formal and is not missing detailed information.
  Comments = When interpreting a medicationStatement, the value of the status and NotTaken needed to be considered:\rMedicationStatement.status + MedicationStatement.wasNotTaken\rStatus=Active + NotTaken=T = Not currently taking\rStatus=Completed + NotTaken=T = Not taken in the past\rStatus=Intended + NotTaken=T = No intention of taking\rStatus=Active + NotTaken=F = Taking, but not as prescribed\rStatus=Active + NotTaken=F = Taking\rStatus=Intended +NotTaken= F = Will be taking (not started)\rStatus=Completed + NotTaken=F = Taken in past\rStatus=In Error + NotTaken=N/A = In Error

The identifier here is one that would be used by another non-FHIR system - for example an automated medication pump would provide a record each time it operated; an administration while the patient was off the ward might be made with a different system and entered after the event.  Particularly important if these records have to be updated.

  Comments = MedicationStatement is a statement at a point in time.  The status is only representative at the point when it was asserted.  The value set for MedicationStatement.status contains codes that assert the status of the use of the medication by the patient (for example, stopped or on hold) as well as codes that assert the status of the medication statement itself (for example, entered in error).\n\nThis element is labeled as a modifier because the status contains codes that mark the resource as not currently valid
