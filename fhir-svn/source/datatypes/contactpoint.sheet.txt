  Inv. = 2
  Type = code
  Binding = ContactPointSystem
  Short Name = phone | fax | email | pager | url | sms | other
  Definition = Telecommunications form for contact point - what communications system is required to make use of the contact
  v2 Mapping = XTN.3
  RIM Mapping = ./scheme
  ServD Mapping = ./ContactPointType

  Element = ContactPoint.value
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = string
  Short Name = The actual contact point details
  Definition = The actual contact point details, in a form that is meaningful to the designated communication system (i.e. phone number or email address).
