=== Sheet CQIF-Questionnaire =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Element = Questionnaire
  Profile Name = CQIF-Questionnaire
  Type = DomainResource
  Short Name = A questionnaire with the ability to specify behavior associated with questions or groups of questions
  Definition = A CQIF questionnaire is a questionnaire with the added ability to describe behavior associated with questions. For example, whether or not to display a particular question or group of questions, or automatically calculating the value of an answer based on the answers to previous questions

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Element = Questionnaire.extension
  Profile Name = library
  Aliases = library
  Type = Extension{http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/cqif-library}
  Short Name = A library containing logic referenced by the questionnaire
  Definition = A CQL or ELM library containing any logic referenced by the questionnaire

 -- Row 3 -----------------------------------
  Element = Questionnaire.item

 -- Row 4 -----------------------------------
  Element = Questionnaire.item.extension
  Profile Name = condition
  Card. = 0..1
  Aliases = condition
  Type = Extension{http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/cqif-condition}
  Short Name = A condition that determines whether or not the group is applicable
  Definition = The name of an expression that determines whether the group on which it appears is applicable. The expression is evaluated within the current context. If the result of evaluating the expression is true, the group is applicable. The expression has access to the current value of answered questions by the linkId of the question
  Comments = Note that per Lloyd this extension may not be necessary, it may be able to specified structurally using the elements already available within Questionnaire

 -- Row 5 -----------------------------------
  Element = Questionnaire.item.extension
  Profile Name = initialValue
  Card. = 0..1
  Aliases = initialValue
  Type = Extension{http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/cqif-initialValue}
  Short Name = An expression that provides the initial value for the answer to the question
  Definition = The name of an expression that determines the initial value for the answer to the question. This expression is evaluated once as part of displaying the form, and does not have access to the answers to other questions

 -- Row 6 -----------------------------------
  Element = Questionnaire.item.extension
  Profile Name = calculatedValue
  Card. = 0..1
  Aliases = calculatedValue
  Type = Extension{http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/cqif-calculatedValue}
  Short Name = An expression that provides a calculated value for the answer to the question
  Definition = The name of an expression that determines a calculated value for the answer to the question. The expression is evaluated as necessary and has access to the answers to other questions by the linkId of the question

 -- Row 7 -----------------------------------
  Element = Questionnaire.item.option

 -- Row 8 -----------------------------------
  Element = Questionnaire.item.option.extension
  Profile Name = optionCode
  Card. = 0..*
  Aliases = optionCode
  Type = Extension{http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/cqif-optionCode}
  Short Name = Meaning of the response option
  Definition = A CodeableConcept that assigns meaning to the response object on which it appears
  Requirements = Need to be able to determine the semantics of each potential response in order to interpret the meaning when processing the questionnaire response.  For example, the response option \"Severe migraines within the past year\" to the question \"Select all that apply\" needs detailed coding (such as via CodeableConcept) at the option level, as well as a way to represent that an affirmation/negative response should result in (perhaps) an Observation in the QuestionnaireResponse tied to a clinical model (such as CIMI). This is key to support sophisticated CDS based on the semantics of the QuestionnaireResponse -- not just the codes
