<h3>Clinical Quality Framework (CQF) Implementation Guide</h3>

<p><i>This draft of the CQF IG is being balloted as FHIR-Based Clinical Quality Framework (CQF-on-FHIR) as an STU ballot for the September 2016 ballot cycle. In addition, this IG will be used to support the CQF-on-FHIR and Payer Extract tracks in the September 2016 FHIR connect-a-thon.</i></p>

<p><i>This Implementation Guide is prepared as a Universal Realm Specification with support from the <a href="http://cqframework.info">Clinical Quality Framework (CQF) initiative</a>, which is a public-private partnership sponsored by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) and the U.S. Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) to identify, develop, and harmonize standards for clinical decision support and electronic clinical quality measurement.</i></p>
