H- Need support for mapping questionnaires to complex data elements
L- Support for calculated elements
M- Do we want "keywords" for data elements?  (similar to LOINC "Related Names")
H- Should definition be made 0..1 instead of 1..1?  LOINC elements don't have definitions
H- QuestionnaireResponse.subject needs to be 0..1 with a rule that it must be present if the status is "complete" - no way to know the patient yet.
- When asserting a mapping, need to be able to assert a concept map for the resulting code
M- Should Questionnaire have a URL like other infrastructure resources?
H- Line breaks aren't showing up in documentation for $populate operation
H- Ensure OperationOutcomes can come back along with QuestionnaireResponse when invoking $populate
H- Need to define what it means to "populate" an "empty" questionnaire
-- should questions nested beneath questions appear?
-- should conditional questions appear if not triggered by data?


- Which conditional parameters should be part of core?
- Document how data elements are referenced by a ConceptMap
- Document how element paths can be referenced by a ConceptMap
- Need a way to be able to make something conditionally required - ideally tied to "enableWhen" - because we don't want child questions to always be required, which is the current interpretation
- Add a code for "source" as a type of display text
- Need a way to capture the "computable" units for a decimal rather than just the display values
- Add ordinal and maybe other extensions for "option"?
- Test scripts should include Audit & Provenance
