      <p>This profile defines the expected capabilities of the <i>SDC Form Response Manager</i> role when conforming to the S&amp;I Framework's <a href="index.html">Structured Data Capture FHIR implementation guide</a>.  This role is responsible for providing read/write access to QuestionnaireResponses.  This is typically to support light-weight clients that want to be able to complete forms but don't have local storage to save work in progress.</p>
