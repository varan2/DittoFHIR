    <h3>Scope and Usage</h3>
    <p>
      This profile sets expectations for use of the <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}questionnaire.html">Questionnaire</a> resource within the 
      <a href="index.html">Structured Data Capture</a> implementation guide.  This includes
      identifying which core elements and extensions must be supported.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the purposes of this profile, <i>Supported</i> means that clients SHALL be capable of processing the element/extension and use the information to control the display
      and information capture associated with the <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}questionnaire.html">Questionnaire</a>.  It means that servers SHALL be capable of persisting 
      those elements and returning them in response to requests.

        <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}element-extensions.html">element-extensions</a> which defines extensions describing constraints on the values for data elements.  There 
        are used here to constrain the allowed values for questions.</li>
      <li>
