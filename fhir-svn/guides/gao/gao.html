        <h2>Guideline Appropriate Ordering</h2>
      </a>
      <p>The purpose of this implementation guide is to support communication of decision support
        guidance on whether or not an order is appropriate from EHR, hospital or departmental
        information systems, and enable receivers to validate that decision support was used to
        determine the appropriateness of those orders according to guidelines.</p>
      <p>The Guideline Appropriate Ordering Profile supplies a mechanism by which EHR and
        departmental systems can evaluate orders to determine whether these orders conform to
        guidelines. The profile enables the results of the evaluation to be stored and transmitted,
        and the receiver of those results to verify that an order was evaluated with regard to
        appropriateness.</p>
      <p> Under a new US law<sup>
          <a href="#fn1">1</a>
        </sup>, starting in 2017, providers ordering imaging procedures must use physician approved
        appropriateness guidelines to reduce unnecessary imaging in patients for whom it is not
        appropriate. In order to be paid for Medicare outpatient care, facilities and physicians who
        perform certain imaging procedures (either the technical or the clinical component) have to
        be able to show that decision support was used in the ordering process<sup>
          <a href="#fn2">2</a>
        </sup>. The European Society of Cardiology and the European Association of Cardiovascular
        Imaging have also identified a need for use of appropriateness criteria in cardiovascular imaging<sup>
          <a href="#fn3">3</a>
        </sup>.</p>
      <h3>Scope</h3>
      <p>This implementation guide is intended to support the use cases where a Clinical Decision
        Support is consulted during the processing of an order to ensure that the requested services
        are appropriate according to clinical guidelines at the time of order entry. It does not
        address orders proposed by a clinical decision support system because it is presumed that
        the CDS system has already ensured that any proposed service is clinically appropriate.</p>
      <p>The focus of this guide is on ensuring that clinical decision support can be integrated
        into the ordering process. As far as this guide is concerned, the operation of CDS service
        itself is a black box. This guide does not specify how guidelines are selected during the
        evaluation, how the evaluation is performed, or the formats used to express the guidance in
        guidelines. </p>
      <p>However, we are especially looking for feedback to ensure that this implementation guide is
        compatible withother mechanisms associated with clinical decision support, including <a
          href="../cqif/cqif-cds-on-fhir.html">CDS on FHIR</a>. In particular, we are interested in
        comparing these two efforts, and understanding how to best provide CDS integration
        capabilities to EHR systems. </p>

      <p>This guide defines the following conformance statements. Systems implementing the actors
